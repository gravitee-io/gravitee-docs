A popular trend in enterprise software development these days is to design very decoupled applications connected via APIs. 
This approach provides an excellent way to reuse functionality across various applications and business units no matter what the implementation technology is.

However, this approach also introduces its own pitfalls and disadvantages including :

* Difficulty discovering or sharing existing APIs
* Difficulty sharing common functionality across API implementations
* Tracking API usage/consumption

API Management enables you to create, manage, secure, track and sharing your APIs by providing tools like API Manager, as well as an API Gateway to direct API traffic by applying policies and API's configurations. API management system tends to provide the following features :

* Centralized governance policy configuration
* Tracking APIs and API consumers
* Easy sharing and discovery APIs
* Leveraging common policy configuration across different APIs

== Gravitee.io
Gravitee.io is a flexible, lightweight and blazing-fast open source API Management solution that helps you and your organizations to control finely who, when and how users access your APIs. Gravitee.io is not only a product, it acts as a global solution for API Management.

=== Architecture Overview

image::architecture_overview.png[]

=== Gateway
The core component of the Gravitee.io solution. You can just compare it to an HTTP proxy to understand
its goal. But in comparison to these proxies, our gateway is applying rules (ie. <<gravitee-policies, policies>>) to
both HTTP requests and responses according to your needs.

=== Management API
RESTful API providing a bunch of services to manage the platform globally. All exposed
services are constraint by authentication and authorization rules.
You can find more information by having a look to the <<gravitee-management-api-overview, Management API>> section.

=== Management UI
This is the Web UI client of Gravitee.io Management API. The Management UI offers the same features as the Management API such as API management, application management, user management, analytics dashboard.

[[gravitee-plugins]]
=== Plugins
_Plugins_ are additional components that can be _plugged into_ the Gateway. _Plugins_ can specialized the _gateway_
behavior to exactly fit your needs.
_Plugins_ follow a given directory structure convention. Look at the <<gravitee-dev-guide-overview, Developer Guide>>
to have more information about it.

Currently, there are three kind of _plugins_ which are:

* <<gravitee-policies, Policies>>
* <<gravitee-reporters, Reporters>>
* <<gravitee-repositories, Repositories>>

[[gravitee-policies]]
==== Policies
Gravitee _plugin_ acting as a step in the Request/Response _gateway_ proxy chain. 
_Policy_ can be treated as a _proxy controller_ by guaranteeing if a given business rule is fulfilled during the
Request/Response processing.

Want to know how create, use, and deploy a _policy_? Check out the  <<gravitee-dev-guide-overview, Developer Guide>>!

[[gravitee-reporters]]
==== Reporters

Gravitee _plugin_ reporting Request/Response _gateway_ events. Like others Gravitee plugins you can create, use, and deploy a _reporter_ thanks to the <<gravitee-dev-guide-overview, Developer Guide>>!

[[gravitee-repositories]]
==== Repositories
Pluggable storage component for APIs' configurations, Policies configurations, Users/Teams configurations and so on.
You can find more information by having a look to the <<gravitee-management-api-repository, Management API : Repository>> section.

== Basic Concepts
Before going further with Gravitee.io, you have to read this section to get a better understanding of the concepts you need
to know to go ahead quickly.

=== API
An API is the main entity used by Gravitee.io. You can see it as a starting point to expose an API through the gateway.

=== Policy
Policy is an other important entity to apply some rules in requests / responses emitted by a consumer and the gateway.
Policies can be chained using a logical order.

Good examples for a policy are:

* Authorization using an API key (see the <<policy-apikey ,api-key policy>>)
* Applying CORS filters
* Applying rate limiting or quota to avoid API flooding.

=== Reporter

Gravitee modules which report GraviteeIO Gateway Request/Response events to supported storage solutions. "Out of the box" reporters are :

* ElasticSearch Engine Reporter
* File Reporter

[[why-gravitee-io]]
== Why Gravitee.io ?
At the beginning, we were searching for an open-source solution to do API Management. Unfortunately, we've never found
the tool which fit exactly our needs and by choosing one of them we know that we have to pull other components and,
for some of them use a dedicated support.

That's the main reason why we launch Gravitee.io : our goal is to provide you an highly integrable solution which
is able to fit perfectly your infrastructure and your business needs.

Also, Gravitee.io has been developed and designed to be fully extensible using its internal plugin system. You must be
able to do whatever you want : defining your own policy, developing your own reporting system, and so on...

Finally, all components provided by Gravitee.io (including gateway and management-api) are really lightweight. We
took an aggressive approach to memory management. This makes things really easier for you in terms of high-availability
and our components can be started in a "blazing-fast" mode (generally speaking, it takes less than 3 seconds for the gateway
to be accessible to consumers).

You see no constraint using Gravitee.io at all ? Sounds good ! So let's go further with Gravitee.io right now !
