This section provides help to manage and configure your APIs, starting from the creation of an API,
working with technical configuration (endpoint, load-balancing, health-check) and providing documentation
to developers.


As we've seen in the <<apim_quickstart_publish.adoc, quick start>> section, you can easily create a new API from scratch.

By clicking the (+) button at the bottom of the portal page, you may see that there are some other ways to create an API:

== Create an empty API
This option lets you to create an API from scratch, meaning that you have to configure your API correctly (name, version,
context-path, backend endpoints, ...) before publishing it to developers.

To understand how to create an API from scratch, please follow the <<apim_quickstart_publish.adoc, quick start guide>>.

NOTE: To complete

== Import a Swagger descriptor
One of the amazing feature of Gravitee.io is the ability to import a Swagger descriptor to create an API. By doing so,
you do not have to complete all the fields required when you're creating a new API from scratch.
Finally, the only thing you have to do is to specify a context-path to expose the API.

.Step1: Import a Swagger descriptor

.Step2: Change values from the Swagger descriptor if required

.Step3: Set the context-path

Now you can navigate to the policies management view, and you will see that all route declared in the Swagger descriptor
 are automatically created in Gravitee.io

.Step3: Good job guy !
