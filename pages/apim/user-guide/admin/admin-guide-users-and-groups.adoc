= Users and Groups

== Users

In the installation guide, you have learnt how to configure different identity providers (see link:/apim_installguide_management_api_configuration.html#authentication_type[how to configure authentication]).

Users are listed in the `Users` section of the `Settings` menu.

Here you can :

 * remove a user account (only if the user is not a primary owner of an api or an application),
 * reset its password (only for users created with the Gravitee form)

If you select a user, you have access to a detailed information about its account and permissions and the ability to manage its groups.

== Groups

Groups represent users groups where you put members of the same team/partner and set their role for the `API` scope and/or `APPLICATION` scope (see link:/apim_adminguide_roles_and_permissions.html[Roles and Permissions] for details).
Once a group is created, you can associate it to an API and/or an application and users with role on this scope become members of the API/Application.

Let use groups to create a `FOO Team` group where you can put all members of your FOO team.

=== How to manage groups
==== Create the `FOO Team` group

You can see that in addition to the group name, you have two other input :

Associate to every new API::
Every time an API is created, this group will be added to it.

Associate to every new Application::
Every time an Application is created, this group will be added to it.

Those checkbox can be useful if the group is transverse (an helpdesk group for example).

==== Configure users

Select the new group and clic on the (+) button to add users

==== Add the group to an API or an application

Go to the API/Application you want to modify and select the `groups` section.

Now you can go to the `memberships` section to find that members of the `FOO Team` are members of the API with the role you have set globally.
