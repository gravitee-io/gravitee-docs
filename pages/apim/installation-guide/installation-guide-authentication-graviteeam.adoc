Here you will find how to configure Gravitee.io to allow users to connect using https://gravitee.io/[Gravitee.io Access Management].

NOTE: For this guide, Gravitee.io AM 2.x (>= 2.0.4) is used.

== Create a client

Before being able to connect to the Gravitee.io portal using Gravitee.io Access Management, you need to create a new client.

Please refer to link:/am/2.x/am_quickstart_register_app.html[Register your first client, window="_blank"] quickstart to set up your first security domain and client application.

WARNING: Be careful, the `Valid Redirect URIs` must match exactly to the domain which is hosting the portal.


=== Get client's credentials

Once your client created, you will be able to get its credentials.
