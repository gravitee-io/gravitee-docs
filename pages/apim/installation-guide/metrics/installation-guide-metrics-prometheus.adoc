[[gravitee-installation-metrics-prometheus]]
= Prometheus

In this part we explain you how to configure Gravitee.io API Gateway to expose metrics to Prometheus.


== API Gateway Configuration

Configure the `gravitee.yml` file to enable metrics service.
By default, Prometheus support is activated and exposed from the API Gateway technical API.

[source,yaml]
----
services:
  metrics:
    enabled: true
    prometheus:
      enabled: true
----

== Prometheus Configuration

Here is an example to ask Prometheus to scrape the API Gateway technical API where from formatted metrics are available.

[source,yaml]
----
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'gio-gw'
    basic_auth:
      username: admin
      password: adminadmin
    metrics_path: /_node/metrics/prometheus
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:18082']
----

== Prometheus UI

Now we have everything correctly configured, we can have a look to Prometheus and explore metrics.
By default, and when running Prometheus, the UI is exposed at http://localhost:9090/graph

.Show `http_client_connections` metrics

If you want to take a look to the memory consumed by the gateway:

.Show `jvm_memory_used_bytes` metrics
