Next sections are describing top components which are part of Gravitee.io.

== Gateway
The gateway is the core component of the Gravitee.io platform. You can compare it to a "smart" proxy to understand its goal.

Unlike traditional HTTP proxy, the gateway is able to apply <<apim_overview_plugins.adoc#gravitee-plugins-policies, policies>> (ie. rules) to
both HTTP requests and responses according to your needs, meaning that you can enhance requests and responses processing
by adding transformation, security, and many other crazy features!

== Management API
A restful API providing a bunch of services to manage and configure the global platform. All exposed
services are constraint by authentication and authorization rules.
You can find more information by having a look to the <<gravitee-management-api-overview, Management API>> section.

== Management UI
This is the Web UI for <<gravitee-components-mgmt-api, Gravitee.io Management API>>. This UI acts as a management tool
for API Publishers but also as a portal for your API Consumers.
