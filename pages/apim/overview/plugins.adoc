_Plugins_ are additional components that can be _plugged into_ the Gateway and / or the Management API.
_Plugins_ can specialized component's behavior to exactly fit your needs and your technical constraints.

They follow a given directory structure convention, look at the <<apim_devguide_plugins.adoc, Developer Guide>>
to have more information about it.

When using Gravitee.io, you must be face to multiple types of _plugins_, in particular:

[[gravitee-plugins-idp]]
== Identity Providers

[[gravitee-plugins-fetchers]]
== Fetchers

[[gravitee-plugins-policies]]
== Policies
A *policy* is acting as a behavior to apply to the request and / or response handled by the _gateway_ and can be chained by a request policy chain or a response policy chain using a logical order.
Policy can be treated like a _proxy controller_ by guaranteeing if a given business rule is fulfilled during request / response processing.

Good examples for a policy are:

* Authorization using an API key (see the <<apim_policies_apikey, api-key policy>>)
* Applying header/query params transformations
* Applying rate limiting or quota to avoid API flooding.

NOTE: Want to know how to create, use, and deploy a custom policy? Check out the <<apim_devguide_policies.adoc, Developer Guide>>!

[[gravitee-plugins-reporters]]
== Reporters

A *reporter* is used by gateway instance to report many types of event:

* Requests/responses metrics : response-time, content-length, api-key, ...
* Monitoring metrics: CPU, Heap usage, ...
* Health-check metrics: status, response code,

"Out of the box" reporters are :

* Elasticsearch Reporter
* File Reporter

NOTE: Like any other plugin you can create, use, and deploy a custom reporter thanks to the
<<apim_devguide_plugins.adoc, Developer Guide>>!

[[gravitee-plugins-repositories]]
== Repositories
Pluggable storage component for APIs' configurations, policies configurations, analytics and so on.
You can find more information by having a look to the <<gravitee-management-api-repository, Management API : Repository>> section.

[[gravitee-plugins-resources]]
== Resources

[[gravitee-plugins-services]]
== Services

[[gravitee-plugins-notifiers]]
== Notifiers

A *notifier* is used to send notifications.
For now the only one available is the *email notifier*, but others like *slack* or *portal* are planned soon.

[[gravitee-plugins-alerts]]
== Alerts

An *alert* allows to send trigger or event to the Alert Engine which will be processed to send a notification with the configured plugin notifier.
The configuration of the notifier is the responsibility of the trigger.
