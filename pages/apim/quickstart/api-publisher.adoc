http://MANAGEMENT_UI_SERVER_DOMAIN (see link:/apim_installguide_portal.html[Gravitee.io Management UI installation] for more information)

NOTE: *Gravitee.io Echo API* : In this tutorial we will use the https://api.gravitee.io/echo[Gravitee.io Echo API] to set up our first proxy API. The Gravitee.io Echo API returns JSON-formatted data via the following URL : https://api.gravitee.io/echo
