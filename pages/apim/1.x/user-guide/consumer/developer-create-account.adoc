Gravitee.io allows user to register from the portal.

== Prerequisites

In order to work correctly:

- the link:/apim/1.x/apim_installguide_rest_apis_configuration.html#sending_emails[email SMTP configuration] must be done

- and the option enabled from the settings part:

== User registration workflow

=== Login form

First of all, the user access to the login form:

=== Sign in

Where he will find a link to sign in, and will be redirected to a registration form:

Then, after filling his first/last names and email, he will be able to sign in.

=== Email validation

But, the process is not finished as there is still a step used mainly to validate the email.

So the user will receive an email with a link to validate registration as below:

By default, the link will be available for 24h (86400s), but this can be changed in the gravitee.yml

```yaml
user:
   creation:
      token:
         expire-after: 86400
```

If the link expire, the user will see this message:

=== Confirm registration

Finally, you just have to confirm registration by defining your password, and.... that's it your registration is fully completed!
