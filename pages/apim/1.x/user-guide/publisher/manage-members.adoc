When the API is defined as a private API, no one can access it through the portal and, as a consequence, no one can
subscribe to the API.

Even if the API is private, you can still give access to some users by managing members of the API.

By default, Gravitee.io is defining three roles for membership:

[cols="2*", options="header"]
|===
^|Role
^|Description

.^| *Primary owner*
.^| When an API is created, the primary owner is the creator of the API. Primary owner can do all possible actions for an API.

.^| *Owner*
.^| Owner is a lightest version of the primary owner role. Owner is not able to change the context-path of the API and not delete it.

.^| *User*
.^| A user is a person who can access the API and subscribe to it through a plan.
