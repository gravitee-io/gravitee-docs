The API rating is a good way to promote your APIs. Only members of the API with correct permissions are allowed to rate it.

Permission RATING:

- CREATE: the user will be able to give a rating from 0 to 5
- READ: the user will be able to see the ratings of the API
- UPDATE: the user will be able to add a comment to his rating
- DELETE: the user will be able to delete any comment

A member can also answer to a rating.

Permission RATING_ANSWER:

- CREATE: the user will be able to answer a rating
- READ: the user will be able to see the rating answers of the API
- DELETE: the user will be able to delete any answer


By default, the API rating is disabled. In order to enable is, there is two configuration file to change:

- On the UI, change the constants.json like this:

[source,json]
----
{
  ...
  "rating": {
    "enabled": true
  }
}
----

- On the REST API, change the gravitee.yml like this:

[source,yaml]
----
...
# Allows to rate an API (default value: false)
rating :
  enabled: true
----
