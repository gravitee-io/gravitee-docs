= Roles and Permissions

Gravitee.io APIM allows you to create custom user roles to fit your needs.
A role is a group of permissions and it has a scope.
Roles defines what you can do with the UI and also with the REST API.

NOTE: The changes may take some few seconds to be effectively applied to a user

Let begin with some vocabulary.

== Glossary
=== Scope
When you log in Gravitee.io APIM, you are redirecting to the portal part of the webui.
What you can do on those screens are driven by your role for the scope `PORTAL`.

If you select an element on your user menu, you are redirected to the management part of the webui.
What you can do on those screens are driven by your role for the scope `MANAGEMENT`.

*A user can only have one `MANAGEMENT` role and one `PORTAL` role.*

Scopes `API` and `APPLICATION` are slightly different.

As an API publisher or consumer, you will have access to APIs and/or Applications.
Gravitee.io allows you to have a different role on every single API and Applications.
Sometimes you are the owner, sometimes a simple user or the person in charge of writing the documentation.
This means that the `API` / `APPLICATION` role makes sense only when it is associated with and API / Application.

=== Role
A role is a functional group of permissions.
There is no limit on the number of roles you're allowed to create.
But don't forget that you need to administrate them ðŸ™‚.

Some roles are specials. The are tagged as `System` or `Default`.

==== System Role
A System Role is a read-only role (i.e. you cannot change permissions) needs by Gravitee.io.
It's the `ADMIN` role scoped `PORTAL` and `MANAGEMENT`, and the `PRIMARY_OWNER` role scoped `API` and `APPLICATION`.
They give user all permissions.

==== Default Role
A Default Role is a role used by Gravitee.io when a role is not specified.
For example, the default `PORTAL` and `MANAGEMENT` role is set to a new registered user.
This why is a role with the lower permissions.

You can change the default on each scope.

=== Permission
A permission a list of actions allowed on a resource. The actions are `Create`, `Read`, `Update` and `Delete`.

Here is the list of permissions by scope

== How to create a custom role.
Let say that we want to create a writer role which allow a user to create documentation on APIs.

=== Create the `WRITER` role
To do that, click on the (+) icon in the table header and fill a the name and the description of the new role

.Create
image::apim/1.x/adminguide/newrole-create.png[Gravitee.io - Create a New Role]

=== Configure the `WRITER` role
You must give `READ` permission on the `DEFINITION` and `GATEWAY_DEFINITION`.
This allow the user to see the API in the api list.
Next, you have to give `CRUD` permission on the DOCUMENTATION.

.Configure
image::apim/1.x/adminguide/newrole-configure.png[Gravitee.io - Configure a New Role]

=== Result
As expected, the user with this role can now only see the documentation menu.

.Menu
image::apim/1.x/adminguide/newrole-menu.png[Gravitee.io - Menu, 200]

NOTE: Granting a GROUP permission for MANAGEMENT role will also require the READ operation for the ROLE permission in order to see which roles are provided by a group.
