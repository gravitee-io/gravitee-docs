= Upgrade to 1.20.13

== Endpoints name restrictions

WARNING: Issues https://github.com/gravitee-io/issues/issues/1578[#1578] and https://github.com/gravitee-io/issues/issues/1939[#1939] introduce a constraint in the endpoint name and endpoint group name.
They must be unique in the all API and cannot contain `:`.

=== Mongodb

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gravitee-io/release/master/upgrades/1.x/1.20.13/mongodb/Find.Endpoints.duplicated.js[upgrades/1.20.13/mongodb/Find.Endpoints.duplicated.js]::
This script find APIs where the uniqueness of endpoints name is not respected as the presence of the character `:` in the name.

Example:
```
$ mongo graviteedb ~/Find.Endpoints.duplicated.js

api.id:  00f8c9e7-78fc-4907-b8c9-e778fc790750
api.name:  My API
api.endpoints: [ foo,foo,bar ]

api.id:  02e27174-e7b2-4ad8-a271-74e7b22ad8a0
api.name:  My API 2
api.endpoints: [ defa:ult ]

```
The first API contains 2 endpoints with the same name (`foo`)  and the second API has an endpoint with `:` in its name.
