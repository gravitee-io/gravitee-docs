= Upgrade to 1.19.0

== Web UI

This release introduces the ability to use markdown editor to write pages with a new execution engine which is more strict and can cause incompatibility with previous versions.

For example, on the previous versions the following syntax was both accepted:
```
###Title
```
and
```
### Title
```

Now with the new execution engine, the correct syntax is the one with a space:
```
### Title
```
The other one will be displayed as is.
