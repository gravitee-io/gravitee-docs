= Upgrade to 1.22.0

== SSL compatibility

Starting from this version, the API Gateway is less permissive for HTTPS requests whereas, with previous versions, the
`Trust All` server certificates was enabled by default, it isn't the case anymore and it's now the responsibility of
the API publisher to ask for `Trust All`. Otherwise, the API publisher must have to configure finely endpoint's trustore.

If you did not configure SSL support for your API's backends, you may probably have to to do it to make them work again.
