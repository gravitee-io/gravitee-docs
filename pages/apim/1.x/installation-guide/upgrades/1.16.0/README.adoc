= Upgrade to 1.16.0

== Web UI

This release introduces the ability to configure the portal through the UI (and store the configuration in database), instead of using constants.json file.
The use of the config file is still available but the JSON format has changed.

_**If you use your own `constants.json` file, please read the documentation to adpat it to the new format.**_
