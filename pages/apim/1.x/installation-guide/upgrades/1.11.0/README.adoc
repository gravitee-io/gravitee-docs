= Upgrade to 1.11.x

NOTE: If you are coming from Gravitee.io APIM 1.10.x, there is no migration script to apply.
You just have to download and install new binaries and go ahead with Gravitee.io API Management.

NOTE: For MongoDB users, please check that your database indices are up-to-date with https://github.com/gravitee-io/gravitee-repository-mongodb/blob/master/src/main/resources/scripts/create-index.js[latest]

== Deprecated features
=== Logging Policy

Logging policy is now deprecated (and will be removed in a future version) and has been replaced by an integrated `logging` feature.
To apply logging, you must have to configure it at the API level from `proxy` screen.
