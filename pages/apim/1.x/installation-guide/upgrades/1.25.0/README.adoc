= Upgrade to 1.25.0

== Application management

Starting with Gravitee.io 1.25, users are now able to manage automatically the OpenID Connect client registration
for their applications. This means that each application created from Gravitee.io APIM may now be associated to an OAuth client
using the OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration.

To follow that new feature, the Rest Management API has been updated to reflect those changes.
