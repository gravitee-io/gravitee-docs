This page describes the concepts you need to understand when using APIM.

[[gravitee-concepts-api]]
== API
*API* is the root concept defined and used by APIM. Think of this as the starting point through which services are exposed to the gateway.

[[gravitee-concepts-publisher]]
== Publisher
In our platform, we define a *publisher* (also called *API publisher*) as the role that declares and manages APIs.

[[gravitee-concepts-consumer]]
== Consumer
In our platform, we define a *consumer* (also called *API consumer*) as the role that consumes APIs. [underline]*PRO-TIP*: A consumer can only consume an API after subscribing to it. 

[[gravitee-concepts-application]]
== Application
An *application* is an intermediate level between a *consumer* and an API. The consumer uses an application to subscribe to the API before they are able to consume it.
