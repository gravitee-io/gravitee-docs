This page describes the concepts you need to understand when using APIM.

[[gravitee-concepts-api]]
== API
*API* is the root concept defined and used by APIM. You can see it as the starting point through which to expose services to the gateway.

[[gravitee-concepts-publisher]]
== Publisher
A *publisher* (also called *API publisher*) is the role defined in the platform for declaring an API and managing it. See also *Consumer*.

[[gravitee-concepts-consumer]]
== Consumer
A *consumer* (also called *API consumer*) is the role defined in the platform for consuming an API. A consumer can only consume an API after subscribing to it. See also *Publisher*.

[[gravitee-concepts-application]]
== Application
An *application* is an intermediate level between a *consumer* and an API. It is used by the consumer to subscribe to that API before being able to consume it.
