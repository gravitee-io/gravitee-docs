== Overview
This page describes the main components included in APIM.

[[gravitee-components-gateway]]
== API Gateway
API Gateway is the core component of the APIM platform. You can think of it like a _smart_ proxy.

Unlike a traditional HTTP proxy, the gateway is able to apply <<apim_overview_plugins.adoc#gravitee-plugins-policies, policies>> (i.e. rules) to
both HTTP requests and responses according to your needs, meaning that you can enhance request and response processing
by adding transformations, security and many other exciting features!

[[gravitee-components-rest-api]]
== REST APIs
These RESTful APIs expose services to manage and configure the <<gravitee-components-mgmt-ui, Management UI>> and the <<gravitee-components-portal-ui, Portal UI>>.
All exposed services are restricted by authentication and authorization rules.
You can find more information in the link:/apim/3.x/apim_installguide_rest_apis_documentation.html[Rest APIs > Documentation] section.

[[gravitee-components-mgmt-ui]]
== APIM Console (Management UI)
This is the web UI for the <<gravitee-components-rest-api, Management API>>.
It acts as a management tool for <<apim_overview_concepts.adoc#gravitee-concepts-publisher, API Publishers>>.
Administrators can also configure global platform settings and specific portal settings.

[[gravitee-components-portal-ui]]
== APIM Portal (Portal UI)
This is the web UI for the <<gravitee-components-rest-api, Portal API>>.
It acts as a management tool for <<apim_overview_concepts.adoc#gravitee-concepts-consumer, API Consumers>>, which they can use to search for, view, try out and subscribe to an API.
They can also use it to manage their <<apim_overview_concepts.adoc#gravitee-concepts-application, Applications>>.
