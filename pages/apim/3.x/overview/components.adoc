== Overview
This page describes the main components included in APIM.

[[gravitee-components-gateway]]
== APIM Gateway
APIM Gateway is the core component of the APIM platform. You can think of it like a _smart_ proxy.

Unlike a traditional HTTP proxy, APIM Gateway has the capability to apply <<apim_overview_plugins.adoc#gravitee-plugins-policies, policies>> (i.e. rules) to
both HTTP requests and responses according to your needs, meaning that you can enhance request and response processing
by adding transformations, security and many other exciting features!
