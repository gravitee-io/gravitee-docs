== Overview

This guide walks you through creating your first application and subscribing to your first API with APIM Portal. For a brief overview of how to set up your first API, see the *Publish your first API* section of the Quick Start Guide.

NOTE: APIM includes several ways to access and secure an API, as described in (link:/apim/3.x/apim_publisherguide_plans_subscriptions.html[API Publisher Plans and subscriptions]).
In this example, we will access an API using an link:/apim/3.x/apim_policies_apikey.html[API Key].
Only trusted applications can access the API data by requesting an API Key.
Let's see how to create an application and generate an API Key.
