This guide walks you through the process of creating and publishing your first API by using the Management UI.
Gravitee.io Management UI can be accessed using the following URL:

http://MANAGEMENT_UI_SERVER_DOMAIN (see link:/apim/3.x/apim_installguide_management_ui_install_zip.html[Gravitee.io Management UI installation] for more information)


NOTE: *Gravitee.io Echo API* : In this tutorial we will use the https://api.gravitee.io/echo[Gravitee.io Echo API] to set up our first proxy API.
The Gravitee.io Echo API returns JSON-formatted data via the following URL : https://api.gravitee.io/echo

== Create your API in the Management UI

. Login to http://MANAGEMENT_UI_SERVER_DOMAIN. (Default Administrator account is admin/admin, see link:/apim/3.x/apim_installguide_authentication.html[security section] for more information)
. Click `Create a new API`

NOTE: To subscribe to an API, you must publish one or more Plans. A Plan will allow you to gain access of the API operations.
[start=6]
. Create a Plan by giving it a name, a description, a security type. Don't forget to trigger the `auto-validation` switch.

NOTE: Make sure to choose link:/apim/3.x/apim_policies_apikey.html[API Key security type]. To go further into the Plan configuration, you can take a look at the link:/apim/3.x/apim_publisherguide_plans_subscriptions.html[Plans and subscriptions Guide]

[start=7]
. For this quickstart, you can skip the `Doc` step. Click `SKIP`.

NOTE: In this step, you can add some Markdown and OpenApi files.

[start=8]
. You can check your API information before deploying it. When you are ready, click `CREATE AND START THE API`.

Congratulations ! Your brand new Echo API has been created, a plan has also been published and if a gateway instance is running, your API has been deployed.

One more step before your API is ready to be used by your consumers: Click `PUBLISH THE API` so this API can be displayed in the Portal.

Now let's see how to consume your API: link:/apim/3.x/apim_quickstart_consume.html[Use your first API]

NOTE: This quick start was just an overview to create your first API. To go further into API management detail, you can take a look at the link:/apim/3.x/apim_publisherguide_manage_apis.html[User Guide]
