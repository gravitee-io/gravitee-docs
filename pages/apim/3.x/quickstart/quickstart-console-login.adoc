== How to access APIM Console

You access APIM Console using the `http://MANAGEMENT_UI_SERVER_DOMAIN` URL created during installation.

During the APIM installation process a default administrator account is created. You can use this account to perform all the management tasks provided by APIM, such as creating APIs, registering users and configuring security.

By default, the login details for the APIM Console administrator account are `admin / admin`.

To log in:

. Open APIM Console.
. Enter the administrator credentials and click *SIGN IN*.

=== API status

You can view the status of all your APIs or only APIs with health checking enabled, by toggling on and off the *View all APIs* option.

For APIs with health checking enabled, clicking the detail of the API redirects you to the Health check page. For more details, see link:{{ '/apim/3.x/apim_publisherguide_backend_services.html' | relative_url }}[Load balancing, failover and health check^].

The APIs can be in three different states:

* If the uptime is over 95%, the API is shown as in an OK state (green)
* If the uptime is between 80 and 95%, the API is shown as in a warning state (orange)
* If the uptime is under 80%, the API is shown as in an error state (red)

=== Customize the dashboard

You can customize the default dashboard view by resizing or removing widgets, or by adding custom metrics, as described in link:{{ '/apim/3.x/apim_how_to_add_custom_metrics_in_dashboards.html' | relative_url }}[How to add custom metrics in dashboards^].

To perform more advanced configuration, see link:{{ '/apim/3.x/apim_installguide_management_ui_configuration.html#home-dashboard' | relative_url }}[Home dashboard^] in the Configuration Guide.
