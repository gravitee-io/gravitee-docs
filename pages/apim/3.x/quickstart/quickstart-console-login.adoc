== How to access APIM Console

You access APIM Console using the `http://MANAGEMENT_UI_SERVER_DOMAIN` URL created during installation.

During the APIM installation process a default administrator account is created. You can use this account to perform all the management tasks provided by APIM, such as creating APIs, registering users and configuring security.

By default, the login details for the APIM Console administrator account are `admin / admin`.

To log in:

. Open APIM Console.
. Enter the administrator credentials and click *SIGN IN*.
