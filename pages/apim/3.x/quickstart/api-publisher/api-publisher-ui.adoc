This guide walks you through the process of creating and publishing your first API by using the Management UI.
Gravitee.io Management UI can be accessed using the following URL:

http://MANAGEMENT_UI_SERVER_DOMAIN (see link:/apim/3.x/apim_installguide_management_ui_install_zip.html[Gravitee.io Management UI installation] for more information)


NOTE: *Gravitee.io Echo API* : In this tutorial we will use the https://api.gravitee.io/echo[Gravitee.io Echo API] to set up our first proxy API.
The Gravitee.io Echo API returns JSON-formatted data via the following URL : https://api.gravitee.io/echo

NOTE: To subscribe to an API, you must publish one or more Plans. A Plan will allow you to gain access of the API operations.
[start=6]
. Create a Plan by giving it a name, a description, a security type. Don't forget to trigger the `auto-validation` switch.
