== Overview

This page explains how to migrate your existing API to Design Studio.
It also summarizes the differences between the APIM Console *Design* function and Design Studio.

== Migrate an API

. Log in to APIM Console.
. Click *APIs*.
. Select your API and click *Design*.

=== Migration rules
The migration rules are the following:

* One flow is created per path.
* If all the policies in a path have the same set of HTTP Methods, then the created flow is configured to accept only the same set of HTTP Method.
* If the policies in a path have different sets of HTTP Methods
** then the created flow is configured to accept only the union of these sets.
Example:

  "/path": [{
    "policy1": {...},
    "methods": ["GET", "POST"],
    ...
  },
  {
    "policy2": {...},
    "methods": ["GET", "DELETE"],
    ...
  }]
+
The created flow will accept the HTTP Methods GET, DELETE and POST.
** A condition is added on each policy of the flow to check the HTTP Method, to match the configuration of each policy from v1 definition.
Example:

  {
    "path-operator": {
      "operator": "STARTS_WITH",
      "path": "/path"
    },
    "methods": ["GET", "DELETE", "POST"],
    "pre": [{
      "name": "policy1",
      "condition": "{#request.method == 'GET' || #request.method == 'POST'}",
      ...
    },{
      "name": "policy2",
      "condition": "{#request.method == 'GET' || #request.method == 'DELETE'}",
      ...
    }],
    ...
  }

== Differences between Design function and new Design Studio

With the *Design* function, HTTP methods were linked directly to policies. With Design Studio, HTTP methods are linked to a flow.
This means that you could have a path with policies linked to different HTTP Methods. The migration transforms each "Path"-"HTTP methods"-"Policy" into one flow.

By default, the selection of a flow is based on the operator defined in the flow itself.

You can use the operator either to select a flow with a path which matches exactly, or when the start of the path matches.
You can then use the *Best match* option to select the flow from the path that is closest.
