== Differences between Design function and new Design Studio

With the *Design* function, HTTP methods were linked directly to policies. With Design Studio, HTTP methods are linked to a flow.
This means that you could have a path with policies linked to different HTTP Methods. The migration transforms each "Path"-"HTTP methods"-"Policy" into one flow.

By default, the selection of a flow is based on the operator defined in the flow itself.

You can use the operator either to select a flow with a path which matches exactly, or when the start of the path matches.
You can then use the *Best match* option to select the flow from the path that is closest.
