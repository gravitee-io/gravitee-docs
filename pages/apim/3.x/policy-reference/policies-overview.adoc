== Overview

APIM is delivered with some default common _policies_, for standard APIM usage. You can also customize APIM by adding your own policies.
The default APIM policies are described in this section.

You can configure these policies in two ways:

    * Using the API *Design* function:

    * Using Design Studio (available from APIM 3.5.x):

NOTE: You can migrate from the former *Design* function to Design Studio by following link:/apim/3.x/apim_policies_migrate.html[this procedure].

== Ant notation

APIM frequently uses Ant notation for path matching:

* `?` matches one character
* `\*` matches zero or more characters
* `**` matches zero or more directories in a path
