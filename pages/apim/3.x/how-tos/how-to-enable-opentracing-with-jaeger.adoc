== Why Enable OpenTracing? 

Enabling OpenTracing gives you the ability to use an open-source tracing system for your microservices. In our case, we've implemented this feature using the open source option, Jaeger.

== How To Enable OpenTracing

1. You must enable the tracing feature in `gravitee.yml`. Search for tracing and change `enabled` from `false` to `true`.
