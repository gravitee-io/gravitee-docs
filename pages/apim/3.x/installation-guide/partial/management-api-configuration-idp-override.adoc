= Configure with `gravitee.yml` or APIM Console

You can configure this provider both in APIM Console and in the `gravitee.yml` configuration file.
Whichever you choose, the configuration is stored in the database.
This means that APIM starts using your new configuration as soon as you click the *Save* button (if configuring in APIM Console) or restart APIM API (if configuring in the configuration file).

WARNING: If you configure the provider in the configuration file and then change the values in APIM Console, all changes are overwritten by the values in the configuration file next time you restart APIM API.
