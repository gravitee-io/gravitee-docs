= Configure with `gravitee.yml` or APIM Console

This provider supports both APIM Console configuration and file configuration.
Whichever you choose, the configuration is stored in the database.
This means that APIM starts using your new configuration as soon as you click the *Save* button in APIM Console, or restart APIM API if you choose to configure the provider via the configuration file.

WARNING: If you choose the configuration file to configure the provider and then change values in APIM Console, all modifications are overwritten by those in the configuration file next time you restart APIM API.
