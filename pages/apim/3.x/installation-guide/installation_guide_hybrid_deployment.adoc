== Overview
When you are running a hybrid architecture (i.e. a mix between on-premise and cloud deployment), there are constraints
(which can be just technical constraints or cost constraints) preventing you from deploying all the components required by
APIM in each data center.

To answer this problem, Gravitee.io APIM is providing hybrid components (in the form of plugins) to think about a new way to define
your architecture and your deployment vision.

That's what we are calling "Hybrid mode" or "Hybrid deployment".


== Architecture

Here it is a typical Gravitee.io hybrid architecture:

.Deployment architecture

== Configuration

To make Gravitee.io API Gateway work in this architecture, you will need two components:

* The first one is a kind of "Technical API Gateway" (green instances on the schema) which is exposing new HTTP services used to bridge HTTP calls to the
 underlying repository (which can be any of our supported repositories such as MongoDB, JDBC and so on...)

* The second components is a classical API Gateway (red instances on the schema)  where we just have to switch the default repository plugin for a new
HTTP bridge repository plugin.


Thanks to these two components, classical API Gateway will be able to "communicate" with the technical API Gateway
through a secured HTTP/S channel. This way, no more datastore installation is required from your cloud DC.


NOTE: What we are calling a technical API Gateway is, in fact, a classical API Gateway which have been improved thanks to
a new plugin.

=== API Gateway - HTTP bridge (server)

==== Installation

To expose the new HTTP API, you have to install a new plugin inside the `plugins` directory of the API Gateway.
This plugin can be found at https://download.gravitee.io/graviteeio-apim/plugins/repositories/gravitee-repository-gateway-bridge-http/

[source,bash]
----
$ wget -O ${GRAVITEEIO_HOME}/plugins https://download.gravitee.io/graviteeio-apim/plugins/repositories/gravitee-repository-gateway-bridge-http/gravitee-repository-gateway-bridge-http-server-${PLUGIN_VERSION}.zip
----

[NOTE]
====
You have to remove some of the existing plugins available by default in the API gateway: the sync service,
all the cache services, the policies and the resources.

For example, in Gravitee.io APIM 1.18.0, the `plugins` directory contains the following files :

 gravitee-gateway-services-localregistry-1.18.0.zip
 gravitee-gateway-services-ratelimit-1.2.0.zip
 gravitee-gateway-services-monitoring-1.18.0.zip
 gravitee-gateway-services-node-healthcheck-1.18.0.zip
 gravitee-reporter-elasticsearch-1.18.0.zip
 gravitee-reporter-file-1.3.0.zip
 gravitee-repository-ehcache-1.0.0.zip
 gravitee-repository-gateway-bridge-http-server-1.0.0.zip
 gravitee-repository-mongodb-1.18.0.zip

====

==== Configuration

Then, you have to configure the new plugin in the `gravitee.yml` configuration file.

[source,yaml]
----
services:
  bridge:
    http:
      enabled: true
      port: 18092
      host: localhost
      authentication:
        # authentication type to be used for the core services
        # - none : to disable authentication
        # - basic : to use basic authentication
        # default is "basic"
        type: basic
        users:
          admin: adminadmin
----

==== Validation

You can test that your API Gateway node is running by sending an HTTP request to port `8082` on `localhost`:

[source,bash]
----
$ curl -X GET http://localhost:18092/_bridge/apis
----

which should give you a response containing an empty array or a list of APIs.

=== API Gateway - HTTP repository (client)

==== Installation

To consume the HTTP bridge, you will need to replace default repository plugin (most probably MongoDB repository) with
a new HTTP repository inside the `plugins` directory of the API Gateway.
This plugin can be found at https://download.gravitee.io/graviteeio-apim/plugins/repositories/gravitee-repository-gateway-bridge-http/

[source,bash]
----
$ wget -O ${GRAVITEEIO_HOME}/plugins https://download.gravitee.io/graviteeio-apim/plugins/repositories/gravitee-repository-gateway-bridge-http/gravitee-repository-gateway-bridge-http-client-${PLUGIN_VERSION}.zip
----

==== Configuration

Then, you have to configure the new plugin in the `gravitee.yml` configuration file.

[source,yaml]
----
management:
  type: http
  http:
    url: http://localhost:18092/
    keepAlive: true
    idleTimeout: 30000
    connectTimeout: 10000
    authentication:
      basic:
        username: admin
        password: adminadmin
----

== Runtime

Now that the API Gateway are installed and well-configured, you are ready to start them.
Finally, your consumers are able to call the API Gateway with the HTTP repository as usual.
