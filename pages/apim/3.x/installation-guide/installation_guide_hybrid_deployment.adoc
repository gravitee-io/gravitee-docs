== Overview
When you are running a hybrid architecture (i.e. a mix between on-premise and cloud deployment), there are constraints
(which can be just technical constraints or cost constraints) preventing you from deploying all the components required by
APIM in each data center.

APIM presents a solution in the form of hybrid components (in the form of plugins), freeing you from these constraints so that you can find a new way to define
your architecture and deployment vision.

We can describe this as _hybrid mode_ or _hybrid deployment_.

== Architecture

This is a typical hybrid APIM architecture:

== Configuration

For APIM Gateway to work in this architecture, you need two components:

* A _technical API gateway_ (shown in green in the diagram) which exposes new HTTP services used to bridge HTTP calls to the
 underlying repository (which can be any of our supported repositories, including MongoDB, JDBC and so on)

* A standard APIM Gateway (shown in red on the schema) with the default repository plugin switched to a new
HTTP bridge repository plugin

With this infrastructure the standard APIM Gateway can communicate with the technical API gateway
through a secure HTTP/S channel, and your cloud data center does not need a datastore installation.

NOTE: What we are describing as a technical API gateway is, in fact, a standard APIM Gateway which has been augmented with
a new plugin.

=== APIM Gateway - HTTP bridge (server)

==== Installation

To expose the new HTTP API, you need Sto install a new plugin inside the `plugins` directory of APIM Gateway.
This plugin can be found at https://download.gravitee.io/graviteeio-apim/plugins/repositories/gravitee-repository-gateway-bridge-http/

[source,bash]
----
$ wget -O ${GRAVITEEIO_HOME}/plugins https://download.gravitee.io/graviteeio-apim/plugins/repositories/gravitee-repository-gateway-bridge-http/gravitee-repository-gateway-bridge-http-server-${PLUGIN_VERSION}.zip
----

[NOTE]
====
You need to remove some of the existing plugins available by default in APIM Gateway: the sync service,
all the cache services, the policies and the resources.

For example, in Gravitee.io APIM 1.18.0, the `plugins` directory contains the following files :

 gravitee-gateway-services-localregistry-1.18.0.zip
 gravitee-gateway-services-ratelimit-1.2.0.zip
 gravitee-gateway-services-monitoring-1.18.0.zip
 gravitee-gateway-services-node-healthcheck-1.18.0.zip
 gravitee-reporter-elasticsearch-1.18.0.zip
 gravitee-reporter-file-1.3.0.zip
 gravitee-repository-ehcache-1.0.0.zip
 gravitee-repository-gateway-bridge-http-server-1.0.0.zip
 gravitee-repository-mongodb-1.18.0.zip

====

==== Configuration

You configure the new plugin in the `gravitee.yml` file.

[source,yaml]
----
services:
  bridge:
    http:
      enabled: true
      port: 18092
      host: localhost
      authentication:
        # authentication type to be used for the core services
        # - none : to disable authentication
        # - basic : to use basic authentication
        # default is "basic"
        type: basic
        users:
          admin: adminadmin
----

==== Check the APIM Gateway node is running

You can test that your APIM Gateway node is running by sending an HTTP request to port `8082` on `localhost`:

[source,bash]
----
$ curl -X GET http://localhost:18092/_bridge/apis
----

You should receive a response containing an empty array or a list of APIs.

=== APIM Gateway - HTTP repository (client)

==== Installation

To consume the HTTP bridge, you need to replace default repository plugins (usually a MongoDB repository) with
a new HTTP repository in the APIM Gateway `plugins` directory.
This plugin can be found at https://download.gravitee.io/graviteeio-apim/plugins/repositories/gravitee-repository-gateway-bridge-http/

[source,bash]
----
$ wget -O ${GRAVITEEIO_HOME}/plugins https://download.gravitee.io/graviteeio-apim/plugins/repositories/gravitee-repository-gateway-bridge-http/gravitee-repository-gateway-bridge-http-client-${PLUGIN_VERSION}.zip
----

==== Configuration

You configure the new plugin in the `gravitee.yml` file.

[source,yaml]
----
management:
  type: http
  http:
    url: http://localhost:18092/
    keepAlive: true
    idleTimeout: 30000
    connectTimeout: 10000
    authentication:
      basic:
        username: admin
        password: adminadmin
----

== Start the APIM Gateways

Start the APIM Gateways. Your consumers will be able to call APIM Gateway with the HTTP repository as usual.
