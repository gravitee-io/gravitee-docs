= Upgrade to 3.18.21

== Elasticsearch

In previous version, the logging index template was using the standard text analyzer for request payloads. This analyzer does not allow to search for content with a special characters (e.g. an email address). The new template defines a custom analyzer to provide this feature.

User that extends the template settings using the `extendedSettingsTemplate` to define a custom `analysis` property **must** add this analyzer to their custom settings:

....
"analysis": {
    "analyzer": {
        "gravitee_body_analyzer": {
            "type": "custom",
            "tokenizer": "whitespace",
            "filter": [
                "lowercase"
            ]
        }
    }
}
....

If your extended settings does not include the `analysis` property, this change does not impact you.
