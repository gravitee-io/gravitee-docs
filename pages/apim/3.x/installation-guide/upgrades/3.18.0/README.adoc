= Upgrade to 3.18.0

=== Platform alerts on multi-environments APIM

Before this version, platform alerts were common to all environments.
That led to inconsistencies while handling platform alerts on multi-environments APIM.

From this version, platform alerts are scoped to the environment.
For example, if you create an alert on your `production` environment, it is related only to this environment.

Old platform alerts existing before Gravitee upgrade will be linked to the default environment.
You will see them disappear from your others (non-default) environments, and will have to recreate them manually if relevant.
