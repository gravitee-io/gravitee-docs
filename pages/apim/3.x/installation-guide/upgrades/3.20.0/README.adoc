= Upgrade to 3.20.0

== Breaking changes

=== Alert Engine
Starting with 3.20.0, APIM is shipped with the new 2.0.0 version of the AlertEngine connector.

Events are sent over http as default behaviour. In order to switch back to websocket:

```yaml
alerts:
  alert-engine:
    ws:
      sendEventsOnHttp: false
```

Please see the link:/ae/apim_installation.html#event_sending_mode[AlertEngine documentation] for more information.
