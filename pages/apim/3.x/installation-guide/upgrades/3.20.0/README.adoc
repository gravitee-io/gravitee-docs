= Upgrade to 3.20.0

== Breaking changes

=== Alert Engine
Starting with 3.20.0, APIM is shipped with the new 2.0.0 version of the AlertEngine connector.

Events are sent over http as default behaviour. In order to switch back to websocket:

```yaml
alerts:
  alert-engine:
    ws:
      sendEventsOnHttp: false
```

Please see the link:/ae/apim_installation.html#event_sending_mode[AlertEngine documentation] for more information.

=== Policy XSLT
From this version, the embedded link:/apim/3.x/apim_policies_xslt.html[XSLT policy] has been updated to version 2.0.0.
For security reasons, default behaviour has changed and some configuration options have been added.

By default, a DOCTYPE declaration will cause an error. This is for security.
If you want to allow it, you can set `policy.xslt.secure-processing` to `false` in the Gateway configuration file (`gravitee.yml`).

[source, yaml]

    secure-processing: false
