= Upgrade to 3.21.0

== Breaking changes

=== Docker images
From this version, to be complient with https://www.tenable.com/audits/items/CIS_Docker_v1.3.1_L1_Docker_Linux.audit:bdcea17ac365110218526796ae3095b1[CIS_Docker_v1.3.1_L1] the docker images are now using the user `graviteeio`
This means that if you use the official images and deploy them to Kubernetes, nothing changes.
If you build your own Dockerfile from Gravitee images, you must give the right rights to the modifications you add
If you deploy in `openshift`, you have to add the following configure:
```yaml
securityContext:
    runAsGroup: 1000
```

=== Management API
In previous versions, sending a POST request to /user/login without an Authorization returned HTTP Response 200.

Starting with 3.21.0, if a POST request to /user/login does not have an Authorization header, it will receive a HTTP response 401 - Unauthorized.
