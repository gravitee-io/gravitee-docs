= Upgrade to 3.10.9

== Elastic Search reporter plugins configuration

Before Gravitee 3.10.9 :

- For ES>=7, GeoIp and UserAgent plugins are enabled by default in Gravitee, and can't be disabled
- For ES<7, those plugins are disabled by default and can be enabled in Gravitee configuration.

Since Gravitee 3.10.9, it behave the same way for all ES versions :
GeoIp and UserAgent plugins are be enabled by default, and can be disabled by overriding default `reporters.elasticsearch.pipeline.plugins.ingest` configuration.

If your Gravitee configuration enables a plugin which is not available on your ES instance, you will get this kind of error message on gateway startup :

`Unable to create ES pipeline 'gravitee_pipeline': status[400] response[{"error":{"root_cause":[{"reason":"No processor type exists with name [geoip]","processor_type":"geoip"}]`

And then, you have to override `reporters.elasticsearch.pipeline.plugins.ingest` default configuration, to remove unrelevant plugin.
