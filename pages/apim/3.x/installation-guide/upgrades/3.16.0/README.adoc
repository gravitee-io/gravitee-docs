= Upgrade to 3.16.0

== API definition import process changes

Gravitee 3.16.0 introduces a new **crossId** in API definition, which identifies entities across environments.
This improves the API import and promotion processes reliability.

If you are using the _API import from JSON definition_ feature,
we **highly recommend** updating your API definitions by re-exporting your API.

Otherwise, if you import an API definition which doesn't contain **crossId**,
Gravitee will do the best-effort to import your API definition without it.

== Deprecations

The Rest API endpoints listed below are deprecated since Gravitee v3.0.9, and will be removed in a future version.
