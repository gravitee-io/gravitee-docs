= Upgrade to 3.0.10

== Breaking Changes

=== Management API

Starting with this version, `Apis` resources require authentication even for the GET method.

If you are using the REST API directly, please note that you should adapt your application.

`Apis` resources start with the path `/management/organizations/DEFAULT/environments/DEFAULT/apis/`

=== Portal API

Starting with this version, `Apis`, `Pages` and `Categories` resources that were public for GET method require authentication if the users have to sign in to access the portal. (forceLogin = true)

If you are using the REST API directly, please note that you should adapt your application.

* `Apis` resources start with the path `/portal/environments/DEFAULT/apis`
* `Pages` resources start with the path `/portal/environments/DEFAULT/pages`
* `Categories` resources start with the path `/portal/environments/DEFAULT/categories`
