= Upgrade to 3.19.0

== Breaking changes

=== Custom policies
For users who developed their own policy using `ApiKeyRepository` or `SubscriptionRepository` to retrieve API keys or subscriptions.

In previous versions, those repositories were overridden with a cached implementation, which was returning active API keys and subscriptions only, in an optimized way.

From this version, `ApiKeyRepository` and `SubscriptionRepository` query the database directly without any cache.
Using them in policies is strongly discouraged.

We recommend to update your dependency settings on `gravitee-gateway-api` to version 1.44.1 and then use those new components to access the active API keys or subscriptions:

* `io.gravitee.gateway.api.service.ApiKeyService` : _getByApiAndKey_
* `io.gravitee.gateway.api.service.SubscriptionService` : _getByApiAndClientId_ and _getById_


=== Docker: Portal nginx configuration
In order to provide a better security, the default nginx configuration of the portal docker image has been updated to add by default a Content-Security-Policies header for framing.
After upgrading, the nginx configuration will be updated with this new line:

[source]
----
add_header Content-Security-Policy "frame-ancestors 'self';" always;
----
But as APIM Portal is embedded in APIM Console for the theme customisation, this new header may block the portal from being displayed in the console.

There are 2 ways to manage this change:

1. *Not recommended*. You can disable this security header by setting the environment variable `FRAME_PROTECTION_ENABLED` to `false` when starting the docker container.
2. You can configure the `frame-ancestors` directive to allow the console to display the portal. To do this set the environment variable `ALLOWED_FRAME_ANCESTOR_URLS` with the list of allowed URLs.
For example:

[source]
----
ALLOWED_FRAME_ANCESTOR_URLS="https://mydomain.com https://mydomain2.com"
ALLOWED_FRAME_ANCESTOR_URLS="https://mydomain.com 'self'"
ALLOWED_FRAME_ANCESTOR_URLS="mydomain.com"
----

See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/frame-ancestors[here^] for more information about the Content-Security-Policy header.

=== Console with a custom base url

By default, the console and the portal are made to work at the root of a URL, for instance:

- `https://apim.portal.com/...`
- `https://apim.console-ui.com/...`

So the assets (image and js files) are loaded from the root, for instance: `https://apim.portal.com/main.js`

But, for different reasons such as DNS limitations, some users would like to use a single domain and share it for all APIM components. Something like:

- `http://apim/portal`
- `http://apim/console`

In this case, both the portal and console applications need to know the `base_href` which allows them to properly load the different assets (`http://apim/portal/main.js`). This should work with whatever URL is used by the user to load the page: a complex link created during login, a redirection, a reload of a page, or just the base URL.

‚ö†Ô∏è Previously the console application was magically working without custom configuration, it's not the case anymore.
In order to handle these scenarios you have the following options:

==== A - Using a reverse proxy

Please refer to this section from the documentation:  https://docs.gravitee.io/apim/3.x/apim_how_to_configure_reverse_proxy.html#nginx_container

This is working thanks to config which will replace the `base_href` with the right value:

[source,nginx]
----
                sub_filter_once  on;
                sub_filter  '<base href="/' '<base href="/console/';
----

==== B - Using environment variables with Gravitee.io APIM Docker images

_Note_: This option is valid only if you're using the official Gravitee.io APIM Docker images.

The portal and console docker images handle environment variables to configure the `base_href` of the apps:

 - `PORTAL_BASE_HREF` for the Portal (it was already there in previous versions)
 - `CONSOLE_BASE_HREF` for the Console (üÜï this one is new)

This variable will change the `base_href` of the app using this kind of configuration:

[source,nginx]
----
        sub_filter '<base href="/"' '<base href="{{ getenv "PORTAL_BASE_HREF" "/" }}"';
----

The full configuration is available here: https://github.com/gravitee-io/gravitee-api-management/blob/master/gravitee-apim-portal-webui/docker/config/templates/default.conf.tmpl


You can find an example of use in a simple Docker Compose setup we have in the repository:
https://github.com/gravitee-io/gravitee-api-management/tree/3.19.x/docker/quick-setup/nginx

The magic is happening because of https://github.com/gravitee-io/gravitee-api-management/blob/b03a8eb705280e5f44d5a58293306d29838e79ee/docker/quick-setup/nginx/docker-compose.yml#L123:

[source]
----
        CONSOLE_BASE_HREF=/console/
----

‚ö†Ô∏è The trailing `/` on the previous snippet is **MANDATORY**

==== B (Bis) - Using environment variables with Helm Chart

If the Helm charts are used in a way that each of the Portal, Console, Management-api and Gateway has its own domain then no specific configuration is needed.

Otherwise, it will be needed to set the correct `PORTAL_BASE_HREF` and `CONSOLE_BASE_HREF` environment variables, as explained in section B.

For instance:

[source,yaml]
----
ui:
  image:
    repository: graviteeio/apim-management-ui
    pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
  ingress:
    tls: false
    hosts:
      - localhost
  baseURL: http://localhost:8081/management/organizations/DEFAULT/environments/DEFAULT/
  env:
    - name: CONSOLE_BASE_HREF
      value: "/console/"
...
portal:
  ...
  env:
    - name: PORTAL_BASE_HREF
      value: "/portal/"
