= Upgrade to 3.19.0

== Breaking changes

=== Custom policies

For users who developed their own policy using `ApiKeyRepository` or `SubscriptionRepository` to retrieve API keys or subscriptions.

In previous versions, those repositories were overridden with a cached implementation, which was returning active API keys and subscriptions only, in an optimized way.

From this version, `ApiKeyRepository` and `SubscriptionRepository` query the database directly without any cache.
Using them in policies is strongly discouraged.

We recommend to update your dependency settings on `gravitee-gateway-api` to version 1.44.1 and then use those new components to access the active API keys or subscriptions:

* `io.gravitee.gateway.api.service.ApiKeyService` : _getByApiAndKey_
* `io.gravitee.gateway.api.service.SubscriptionService` : _getByApiAndClientId_ and _getById_
