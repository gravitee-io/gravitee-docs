= Upgrade to 3.0.7

== Breaking changes

The `portalURL` parameter in the gravitee.yml file has been removed.
It has become useless with this issue https://github.com/gravitee-io/issues/issues/4144[#4144].

As this `portalURL` stands for the former portal, it will be replaced by the `management.url` parameter in the console settings.
This parameter will be initialized with the former `portalURL` value if it still exists in your gravitee.yml.
Otherwise, the default value of `management.url` is http://localhost:3000

The `portal.url` parameter in the console settings will also have a default value : http://localhost:4100
