= Upgrade to 3.6.0

== Elasticsearch

With Elasticsearch version above 7.x, `geoip` and `user_agent` plugins are automatically enabled.

== APIM API

Two new configuration keys have been added to the `gravitee.yml` file, they should be set with the URLs of the UI console and the management API:
```yml
console:
  ui:
    url: gravitee_apim_ui_url # TO UPDATE WITH YOUR OWN URL
  api:
    url: gravitee_apim_management_api_url # TO UPDATE WITH YOUR OWN URL
```

NB: **For Gravitee Cockpit to work properly these URLs are mandatory**, they will be used by Cockpit to interact with your APIM installation.
