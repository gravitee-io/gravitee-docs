=== Change of return type when calling /apis/{apiId}/subscribers

To improve performance while fetching the subscribers of an API, internal methods have changed and the output has evolved.
As a result, a call to  `/organizations/{orgId}/environments/{envId}/apis/{apiId}/subscribers` now returns a list of `ApplicationListItem` instead of `ApplicationEntity`.

The `ApplicationListItem` class contains all the fields present in the `ApplicationEntity` class.
