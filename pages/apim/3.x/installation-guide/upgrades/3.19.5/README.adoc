= Upgrade to 3.19.5

== Breaking changes

From this version, the embedded link:/apim/3.x/apim_policies_xslt.html[XSLT policy] has been updated to version 2.0.0.
For security reasons, default behaviour has changed and some configuration options have been added.

By default, a DOCTYPE declaration will cause an error. This is for security.
If you want to allow it, you can set `policy.xslt.secure-processing` to `false` in the Gateway configuration file (`gravitee.yml`).
