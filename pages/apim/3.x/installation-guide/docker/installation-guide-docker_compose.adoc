== Run Gravitee.io API Management

You can launch a complete Gravitee.io API Management stack using our ready-to-use docker-compose file.

This latest is including Gravitee.io API Management + MongoDB + Elasticsearch.

WARNING: Before running the commands below, make sure you have the minimum vm.max_map_count property set in order to run Elasticsearch properly. https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/vm-max-map-count.html[Click here] to see how to check the current value and update if necessary.

[source,shell]
....
# Download docker-compose file
$ curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gravitee-io/gravitee-docker/master/apim/3.x/docker-compose.yml -o "docker-compose.yml"

# (Optional step: pull to ensure that you are running latest images)
$ docker-compose pull

# And run...
$ docker-compose up
....

== Check your platform

When all components are started, you can do a quick test to see if everything is ok by checking these urls:

|===
|Component |URL| Expected

|API Gateway
|http://localhost:8082/
|Must return 404 status code, with a `No context-path matches the request URI` payload.

|Management API
|http://localhost:8083/management/organizations/DEFAULT/environments/DEFAULT/apis
|Must return a 200 status code, with a `[]` payload.

|Management UI
|http://localhost:8084/
|Must return a 200 status code, showing the Management UI

|Portal UI
|http://localhost:8085/
|Must return a 200 status code, showing the Portal
