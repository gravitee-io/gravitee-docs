:page-layout: apim3x


Reporters are designed to record a variety of events occurring in the gateway, to a variety of outputs and formats, in their order of occurrence. This enables you to manage this data using a solution of your choice.

The following event types are supported.

== Event types

[cols="1,1"]
|===
|Type|Description

|`request`
|This event type provides common request and response metrics, such as response time, application, request ID, and more.

|`log`
|This event type provides more detailed request and response metrics. It is reported when logging has been enabled at the API level. 

|`healthcheck`
|This event type allows for healthcheck events to be reported when a healthcheck endpoint has been configured and enabled on an API.

|`node`
|This event type provides some system and JVM metrics for the node Gravitee is running on.

== Configuring Reporters

=== Elasticsearch Reporter

Configuration details for the elasticsearch reporter are available in the link:{{ '/apim/3.x/apim_installguide_repositories_elasticsearch.html' | relative_url }}[Elasticsearch Repository] documentation.

=== File Reporter

==== Configuration Parameters
[cols="1,1,1"]
|===
| Parameter name
| Description
| Default value

| `enabled`
| This setting determines whether the file reporter should be started or not. The default value is `false`.
| false

| `fileName`
| The path events should be written to. Use the `%s-yyyy_mm_dd` pattern to create one file per event type on a daily basis.
| *#{systemProperties['gravitee.home']}/metrics/%s-yyyy_mm_dd}*

| `output`
| Output file type - json, message_pack, elasticsearch, csv.
| *json*

| `flushInterval`
| File flush interval (in ms).
| *1000*

| `retainDays`
| The number of days to retain files before deleting one.
| *0 (to retain forever)*

| `<EVENT_TYPE>.exclude`
| Fields to exclude from the output. Available for `json` and `message_pack` outputs only.
| *none*

| `<EVENT_TYPE>.include`
| Fields to include in the output. Available for `json` and `message_pack` outputs and only if excludes have been defined.
| *none*

| `<EVENT_TYPE>.rename`
| Fields to rename when writing the output. Available for `json` and `message_pack` outputs only.
| *none*
|===

NOTE: <EVENT_TYPE> refers to the kind of event reported by the gateway and can be either `request`, `log`, `node` or `healthcheck`. Fields referenced as `exclude`, `include` and `rename` items all support link:https://github.com/json-path/JsonPath[jsonPath] for accessing nested elements.

==== Example

The configuration example below excludes all fields from the request JSON file except the `api` and
`application` fields, renames the `application` field to `app`, and excludes `log`, `node`, and `healthcheck` events from being reported.

[source,yaml]
----
reporters:
  file:
    enabled: true 
    fileName: ${gravitee.home}/metrics/%s-yyyy_mm_dd
    output: json 
    request: 
      exclude: 
        - "*"
      include: 
        - api
        - application
      rename: 
        application: app
    log:
      exclude: *
    node:
      exclude: *
    healthcheck:
      exclude: *

=== TCP Reporter

==== Configuration Parameters
[cols="1,1,1"]
|===
| Parameter name
| Description
| Default value

| `enabled`
| This setting determines whether the TCP reporter should be started or not. The default value is `false`.
| false

| `output`
| Format of the data written to the TCP socket - json, message_pack, elasticsearch, csv.
| *json*

| `host`
| The TCP host where the event should be published. This can be a valid host name or an IP address.
| *localhost*

| `port`
| The TCP port used to connect to the host.
| *8123*

| `connectTimeout`
| Maximum time allowed to establish the TCP connection in milliseconds.
| *10000*

| `reconnectAttempts`
| This setting determines how many times the socket should try to establish a connection in case of failure.
| *10*

| `reconnectInterval`
| Time (in milliseconds) between socket connection attempts.
| *500*

| `retryTimeout`
| If the max reconnect attempts have been reached, this setting determines how long (in milliseconds) the reporter should wait before trying to connect again.
| *5000*

|===

==== Example

The following example uses the same configuration as the previous example above, however it writes the events to a TCP socket instead of a file.

[source,yaml]
----
reporters:
  tcp:
    enabled: true 
    host: localhost
    port: 9001
    output: json 
    request: 
      exclude: 
        - "*"
      include: 
        - api
        - application
      rename: 
        application: app
    log:
      exclude: *
    node:
      exclude: *
    healthcheck:
      exclude: *
