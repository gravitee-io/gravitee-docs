== Overview

You can configure _dashboards_ in APIM Console, which are views presenting different types of analytics in various formats.
You can create new dashboards and configure dashboards to show the analytics you want.

You can create dashboards at three different levels:

- For the entire APIM platform, viewable with the main APIM Console *Dashboard* menu option.
- For APIs, viewable with the *APIs* menu option, by selecting an API and clicking *Analytics*.
- For applications, viewable with the *Applications* menu option, by selecting an application and clicking *Analytics*.

== Create or configure a dashboard

Dashboards are configured by adding and removing _widgets_, which are containers for different types and views of data. You can configure widgets to display charts, for example.

. link:/apim/3.x/apim_quickstart_console_login.html[Log in to APIM Console^].
. Click *Settings > Analytics*.
. Perform one of the following:
- Add a new platform-wide dashboard by clicking *ADD A NEW DASHBOARD PLATFORM*
- Add a new API-level dashboard by clicking *ADD A NEW DASHBOARD API*
- Add a new application-level dashboard by clicking *ADD A NEW APPLICATION API*
- Select a dashboard from one of the three dashboard lists to configure it.
. Click the plus icon image:apim/3.x/icons/plus-icon.png[] to add new widgets to the dashboard.
. Select the widget type from the list and specify the other values.

TIP: Click *ENABLE PREVIEW* to preview your dashboard changes before saving.

. Click *SAVE*.

Once the dashboard appears in the list, you can:
- Delete it
- Disable it
- Move it up the list to appear higher in the dashboard menu
