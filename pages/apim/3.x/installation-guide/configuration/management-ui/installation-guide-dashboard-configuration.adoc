== Overview

You can configure _dashboards_ in APIM Console to display different types of analytics in various formats.
For each dashboard, you can choose the type of data displayed and the format of the display, such as a chart, map or table. You can also specify a filter, to display analytics only for the queries you want.

You can create generic dashboards for the whole APIM platform, or specific dashboards for APIs and applications.

* Platform-wide dashboards are viewable through the APIM Console *Dashboard* menu option, by clicking the *ANALYTICS* tab.
* API dashboards are viewable through the *APIs* menu option, by selecting an API and clicking *Analytics*.
* Application dashboards are viewable through the *Applications* menu option, by selecting an application and clicking *Analytics*.

You can create multiple dashboards of each type with different configurations, and choose the order in which they are displayed in the menu.

== Create or configure a dashboard

Dashboards are configured by adding and removing _widgets_, which are containers for different types and views of data.
