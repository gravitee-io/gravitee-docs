== Why Should I Enable OpenTracing?

Using OpenTracing allows Gravitee to trace every request that comes through the APIM Gateway, creating a deep level of insight on API policies and making debugging a cinch. Without OpenTracing, you'll only receive limited details â€“ making monitoring and troubleshooting complicated and time-consuming.

So, if you're looking for a way to simplify debugging, improve monitoring, and enhance visibility into requests across multiple services, Gravitee's OpenTracing solution with Jaeger as a tracer has you covered. Learn how to set up OpenTracing with the instructions below.


== How To Enable OpenTracing

In the `gravitee.yml` file, enable tracing by adding the following configuration:

----
tracing:
    enabled: true
    type: jaeger
    jaeger:
    host: localhost
    port: 14250
----

Here, you *must* change `enabled` from `false` to `true`.

And that's it! You've enabled OpenTracing on APIM Gateway.
