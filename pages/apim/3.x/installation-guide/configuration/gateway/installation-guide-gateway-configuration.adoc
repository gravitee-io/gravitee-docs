== `gravitee.yml` configuration

[[api-gateway-http-server]]
== HTTP Server

[source,yaml]
----
http:
  port: 8082
  host: 0.0.0.0
  idleTimeout: 0
  tcpKeepAlive: true
  compressionSupported: false
  maxHeaderSize: 8192
  maxChunkSize: 8192
  instances: 0
  requestTimeout: 30000
  secured: false
  alpn: false
  ssl:
    clientAuth: none # Supports none, request, requires
    keystore:
      path: ${gravitee.home}/security/keystore.jks
      password: secret
    truststore:
      path: ${gravitee.home}/security/truststore.jks
      password: secret
----

=== How to enable HTTPS support
First, you need to provide a keystore. If you don't have one, you can generate it :
----
keytool -genkey \
  -alias test \
  -keyalg RSA \
  -keystore server-keystore.jks \
  -keysize 2048 \
  -validity 360 \
  -dname CN=localhost \
  -keypass secret \
  -storepass secret
----

After that, you have to enable secure mode in your `gravitee.yml` :
----
http:
  port: 8082
  host: 0.0.0.0
  idleTimeout: 0
  tcpKeepAlive: true
  compressionSupported: false
  maxHeaderSize: 8192
  maxChunkSize: 8192
  instances: 0
  requestTimeout: 30000
  alpn: false
  secured: true
  ssl:
    clientAuth: none # Supports none, request, requires
    keystore:
      path: /path/to/keystore.jks
      password: adminadmin
    truststore:
      path:
      password:
----

=== How to enable HTTP/2 support

You first need to enable HTTPS support. Then, you just have to enable alpn in the `gravitee.yml` :
----
http:
  alpn: true
  ...
----

Now the gateway supports both HTTP 1 and HTTP/2 protocol. You can consume your api like that :
----
curl -k -v --http2 https://localhost:8082/my_api
----

=== How to enable WebSocket support
----
http:
  websocket:
    enabled: true
----

Now the gateway supports both WS and WSS protocols. You can consume your api like that :
----
curl ws://localhost:8082/my_websocket
----


=== How to enable certificate-based client authentication
----
http:
  ssl:
    clientAuth: none # Supports none, request, requires
    truststore:
      path: /path/to/truststore.jks
      password: adminadmin
----

Available mode for `clientAuth` are:

* none: Client authentication is disabled (replacement of the `false` value)
* request: Client authentication is not required but can be if using link:apim_policies_ssl_enforcement.html[SSL enforcement policy]
* requires: Client authentication is required (replacement of `true` value)

== Plugins repository

Gravitee.io Gateway <<gravitee-plugins,plugins>> directory configuration.

[source,yaml]
----
plugins:
  path: ${gravitee.home}/plugins
----

== Management repository

Management repository is used to store global configuration such as APIs, applications, apikeys, ...
This is the default configuration using MongoDB (single server). For more information about MongoDB configuration, please have a look to:

http://api.mongodb.org/java/current/com/mongodb/MongoClientOptions.html[window=\"_blank\"]

[source,yaml]
----
management:
  type: mongodb
  mongodb:
    dbname: ${ds.mongodb.dbname}
    host: ${ds.mongodb.host}
    port: ${ds.mongodb.port}
#    username:
#    password:
#    connectionsPerHost: 0
#    connectTimeout: 500
#    maxWaitTime: 120000
#    socketTimeout: 500
#    socketKeepAlive: false
#    maxConnectionLifeTime: 0
#    maxConnectionIdleTime: 0
#    serverSelectionTimeout: 0
#    description: gravitee.io
#    heartbeatFrequency: 10000
#    minHeartbeatFrequency: 500
#    heartbeatConnectTimeout: 1000
#    heartbeatSocketTimeout: 20000
#    localThreshold: 15
#    minConnectionsPerHost: 0
#    sslEnabled: false
#    threadsAllowedToBlockForConnectionMultiplier: 5
#    cursorFinalizerEnabled: true

# Management repository: single MongoDB using URI
# For more information about MongoDB configuration using URI, please have a look to:
# - http://api.mongodb.org/java/current/com/mongodb/MongoClientURI.html
#management:
#  type: mongodb
#  mongodb:
#    uri: mongodb://[username:password@]host1[:port1][,host2[:port2],...[,hostN[:portN]]][/[database][?options]]

# Management repository: clustered MongoDB
#management:
#  type: mongodb
#  mongodb:
#    servers:
#      - host: mongo1
#        port: 27017
#      - host: mongo2
#        port: 27017
#    dbname: ${ds.mongodb.dbname}
#    connectTimeout: 500
#    socketTimeout: 250
----

== Rate Limit repository

When defining <</apim_policies_rate_limiting.html, rate-limiting policy>>, the gateway has to store data to share with other gateway instances.

In this example, we are using MongoDB to store counters.

[source,yaml]
----
ratelimit:
  type: mongodb
  mongodb:
    uri: mongodb://${ds.mongodb.host}/${ds.mongodb.dbname}
----

== Reporters

Reporters configuration (used to store reporting monitoring data, request metrics, healthchecks and others...)
All reporters are enabled by default. To stop one of them, you have to add the property 'enabled: false'

[source,yaml]
----
reporters:
  elasticsearch:
    endpoints:
      - http://localhost:9200
#    index: gravitee
#    bulk:
#       actions: 500           # Number of requests action before flush
#       flush_interval: 1      # Flush interval in seconds
#    security:
#       username:
#       password:
----

== Services

Gravitee.io Gateway services configuration. Provided values are default values. All services are enabled by default. To stop one of them, you have to add the property 'enabled: false' (See the 'local' service for an example).

[source,yaml]
----
services:
  # Synchronization daemon used to keep the gateway state in sync with the configuration from the management repository
  # Be aware that, by disabling it, the gateway will not be sync with the configuration done through management API and management UI
  sync:
    # Synchronization is done each 5 seconds
    cron: '*/5 * * * * *'

  # Service used to store and cache api-keys from the management repository to avoid direct repository communication
  # while serving requests.
  apikeyscache:
    delay: 10000
    unit: MILLISECONDS
    threads: 3 # Threads core size used to retrieve api-keys from repository.

  # Local registry service.
  # This registry is used to load API Definition with json format from the file system. By doing so, you do not need
  # to configure your API using the web console or the rest API (but you need to know and understand the json descriptor
  # format to make it work....)
  local:
    enabled: false
    path: ${gravitee.home}/apis # The path to API descriptors

  # Gateway monitoring service.
  # This service retrieves metrics like os / process / jvm metrics and send them to an underlying reporting service.
  monitoring:
    delay: 5000
    unit: MILLISECONDS

  # Endpoint healthcheck service.
  healthcheck:
    threads: 3 # Threads core size used to check endpoint availability
----

== Sharding tags

You can apply sharding on Gateway's instances either with system properties or with a configuration as below.
System properties overrides the yaml configuration.

In this example, you are asking deployment only for APIs tagged 'product' or 'store' and among it, you exclude the APIs tagged 'international'.

[source,yaml]
----
tags: 'product,store,!international'
----

== Default configuration

Various properties can be specified inside your `GRAVITEE_HOME/config/gravitee.yml` file. This section provides the general configuration of Gravitee.IO Gateway.

[source,yaml]
