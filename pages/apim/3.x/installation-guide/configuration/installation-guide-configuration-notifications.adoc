== Overview

APIM includes three categories of notifications:

- *Portal* -- notifications about the platform
- *API* -- notifications about a specific API
- *Application* -- notifications about a specific application

There are also three types of notifiers:

- *Portal* -- this is the default notifier; messages are sent to users logged in to APIM Portal
- *Email* -- you can configure an email notifier to send messages to a specific list of email addresses
- *Webhook* -- you can configure a webhook notifier to send an HTTP POST request to a specific URL

APIM includes a standard set of notifiers. You can also create new notifiers. For more details, see <<Notifiers>>.

== Notifiers
=== Portal
The Portal notifier sends messages to logged in users.
Notifications can be displayed by clicking the bell icon in the top menu of APIM Console.

image::apim/3.x/installation/notification/graviteeio-installation-configuration-notifications-portal-notifier-console.png[Notifications in the APIM Administration console, 300]

In APIM Portal, notifications are displayed in a specific page, accessible from the user menu.

image::apim/3.x/installation/notification/graviteeio-installation-configuration-notifications-portal-notifier-portal.png[Notifications in the developer portal]

The templates of portal notifications can be customized in *Settings*. For more information, see <<Templates>>.

=== Email
Email notifiers send an email to a specific list of email addresses.
To create a new email notifier:

. Click the plus icon.
. Choose the *Default Email Notifier* type and give your notifier a name.
. Add one or more email addresses.
. Subscribe to the notifications you want.

[NOTE]
====
When you create an API, a default email notifier is created. All notifications are selected and email are send to the primary owner.

====

The templates of email notifications can be customized in *Settings*. See <<Templates>>

=== Webhook
Webhook notifiers send an HTTP POST request to a configured URL. The request contains two headers and a JSON body that represents the message.
Headers are:

- `X-Gravitee-Event` -- contains the event id (e.g. `API_KEY_REVOKED`)
- `X-Gravitee-Event-Scope` -- contains the category of the notification (e.g. `API`)

The JSON body looks like this (depending on the category of the notification, some fields may not be present in the body):
```json
{
  "event": "",
  "scope": "",
  "api": {
    "id": "",
    "name": "",
    "version": ""
  },
  "application": {
    "id": "",
    "name": ""
  },
  "owner": {
    "id": "",
    "username": "",
    "owner": ""
  },
  "plan": {
    "id": "",
    "name": "",
    "security": "",
    "plan": ""
  },
  "subscription": {
    "id": "",
    "status": "",
    "subscription": ""
  }
}
```

To create a new webhook notifier:

. Click the plus icon.
. Choose the *Default Webhook Notifier* type and give your notifier a name.
. Add the URL which APIM will call to send notifications.
. Subscribe to the notifications you want.


== Templates

Email and portal notification templates are based on HTML and YML files.
They are located here:
[source,yaml]
----
templates:
  path: ${gravitee.home}/templates
----

Starting from APIM version 3.4.0, you can override these templates in APIM Console.

image::apim/3.x/installation/notification/graviteeio-installation-configuration-notifications-templates-1.png[Templates edition in the settings]

You can also customize:

- Email templates that are sent for specific actions and not related to a notification. Most of the time, these emails are for specific users.
- The `header.html` file that is included by default in all email templates.

image::apim/3.x/installation/notification/graviteeio-installation-configuration-notifications-templates-2.png[Specific templates]

=== Customize a template
For almost all notifications, you can configure both Portal and email notifications.

To customize a template, toggle the switch *Override default template* and update the title and/or the content.
