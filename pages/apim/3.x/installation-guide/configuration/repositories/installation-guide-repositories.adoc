In Gravitee.io APIM, repositories are used to store different type of data (different scopes).
Repositories are configured in the `gravitee.yml` configuration file and can be different for each scope.
For example, you can decide to store management data in MongoDB, rate limiting data in Redis and analytics data in Elasticsearch.
