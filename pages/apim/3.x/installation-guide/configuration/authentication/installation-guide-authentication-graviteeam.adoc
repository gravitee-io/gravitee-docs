== Overview

This page explains how to configure APIM authentication using the https://www.gravitee.io/products/access-management[Gravitee.io Access Management^] product.

NOTE: The examples below are based on Access Management 2.x (2.0.4 or above).

== Create a new client in Access Management

Before you can connect to APIM using Access Management (AM), you need to create a new client.

See link:/am/current/am_quickstart_app_setup.html[Set up your first application^] in the AM documentation for guidance on setting up your first security domain and client application.

WARNING: The `Valid Redirect URIs` value must exactly match the domain hosting APIM Portal.

=== Retrieve client credentials

After you create the client, you can retrieve its credentials for authentication configuration.

==== APIM Console configuration

. Click *Organization Settings > Authentication*.
. Click the plus icon image:icons/plus-icon.png[role="icon"] and select the *Gravitee.io AM* icon.
. If you want to use this provider to log in to APIM Portal, ensure that *Allow portal authentication to use this identity provider* is checked. To use it only for APIM Console, uncheck this option.
. Enter the details of the provider, including the credentials created in the AM client.

. Click *CREATE*.
. Activate the provider for Portal or Console login, as described in link:/apim/3.x/apim_installguide_authentication.html#activating-providers[Activating providers^].

            - "ENVIRONMENT:API_CONSUMER"                  #applied to the DEFAULT environment
            - "ENVIRONMENT:DEFAULT:API_CONSUMER"          #applied to the DEFAULT environment
            - "ENVIRONMENT:<ENVIRONMENT_ID>:API_CONSUMER" #applied to environment whose id is <ENVIRONMENT_ID>

== Test the configuration

=== Create a user in AM

See link:/am/current/am_quickstart_app_setup.html[Set up your first application^] for guidance on setting up your new AM user.

NOTE: APIM requires an `email` profile to enable portal authentication. If you create an Inline identity provider in AM, you need to specify an email address in the *Username* field.
