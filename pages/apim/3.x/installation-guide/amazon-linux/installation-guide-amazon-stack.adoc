== Overview

Ready to install APIM? Excellent! In this section, you'll learn how to install the full APIM stack (including all components), along with optional dependencies (MongoDB, Elasticsearch).

To install APIM components individually, see the respective documentation for link:/apim/3.x/apim_installguide_hybrid_deployment.html#architecture[APIM Gateway], link:/apim/3.x/apim_installguide_amazon_management_api.html[APIM API], link:/apim/3.x/apim_installguide_amazon_management_ui.html[APIM Console], and link:/apim/3.x/apim_installguide_amazon_portal.html[APIM Portal].

== Prerequisites

. [underline]#*Nginx*# must be installed.

. [underline]#*YUM package manager*# must be configured (link:/apim/3.x/apim_installguide_amazon_configure_yum.html[click here] for instructions on how to configure `yum`).

. You must have access to a **t2.medium instance** size in AWS.

=== Install Nginx

To install Nginx, run the following commands:

[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
sudo amazon-linux-extras install nginx1.12
sudo systemctl start nginx
----

=== Configure YUM Package Manager
link:/apim/3.x/apim_installguide_amazon_configure_yum.html[Click here] for instructions on how to configure `yum`.

== Install APIM Package With Dependencies
With almost every Amazon install, you'll need to set up the required dependencies *__before__* attempting to install APIM.

Already have all dependencies installed? Skip to link:/apim/3.x/apim_installguide_amazon_stack.html#install_apim_package_no_dependencies[this section.]


=== 1. Configure Your Amazon Instance
In your AWS settings, choose the following:

* *[underline]#For Instance Type/Size#*. Select a **t.2medium** instance.

* *[underline]#For IP Address#*. Choose to **auto-assign a public IP** for this option.

* *[underline]#For Storage#*. Generally, **40GB** is a good amount.

* *[underline]#For Security Groups#*. Open the ports listed below so that after you complete the installation, you can check the necessary URLs to ensure that APIM has been installed properly:

** 8082 (for APIM).
** 8083 (for APIM API).
** 8084 (for APIM Console).
** 8085 (for APIM Portal).

=== 2. Configure Dependency Repositories

Before you install the APIM package, you may need to add third-party repositories:

==== *[underline]#MongoDB#*

NOTE: For guidance on installing and configuring MongoDB, see the link:https://docs.mongodb.com/v3.6/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-amazon/[MongoDB Installation documentation., window=\"_blank\"]

[source,bash]
----
echo "[mongodb-org-3.6]
name=MongoDB Repository
baseurl=https://repo.mongodb.org/yum/amazon/2013.03/mongodb-org/3.6/x86_64/
gpgcheck=1
enabled=1
gpgkey=https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-3.6.asc" | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/mongodb-org-3.6.repo > /dev/null

sudo yum install -y mongodb-org
sudo systemctl start mongod
----

==== *[underline]#Elasticsearch 7.x#*

NOTE: For guidance on installing and configuring Elasticsearch, see the link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.6/rpm.html#rpm-repo[Elasticsearch installation documentation, window=\"_blank\"].

[source,bash]
----
echo "[elasticsearch-7.x]
name=Elasticsearch repository for 7.x packages
baseurl=https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/7.x/yum
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch
enabled=1
autorefresh=1
type=rpm-md" | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/elasticsearch.repo > /dev/null
sudo yum install -y elasticsearch
sudo systemctl start elasticsearch
----


=== 3. Install APIM

[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
curl -L https://bit.ly/install-apim-3x | bash
----

=== 4. Modify The Config File

==== Known Issue
Due to our current install scripting, you must modify the *Developer Portal config.JSON file* before attempting to login to the Developer Portal.

If you attempt to open and run the Developer Portal before modifying the config file, you'll see an error similar to this:

image::apim/3.x/installation/amazon-known-issues/amazon-install-deveportalui-known-issue-fix-config-file1.png[Developer Portal Amazon Config File Known Issue]

Follow these steps to modify the Developer Portal config.JSON file.

1. On your favorite terminal, drill into the APIM directory using `cd apim`.

2. Then, cd into portalui using `cd portal-ui/`.

3. Drill into the assets folder using `cd assets/`.

4. Then, view the config file with `vi config.JSON`.

5. Initially, the config file will show an additional prefix on the `baseURL` which must be removed (URL: http://localhost:8083http://your-IP-address:8083/environment/DEFAULT
).
+
For example (see screenshot below), the extra URL at the start: http://localhost:8083 *must be deleted.*
+
image::apim/3.x/installation/amazon-known-issues/amazon-install-deveportalui-known-issue-fix-config-file2.png[Developer Portal Amazon Config File Incorrect URL]

6. Now, you can use `sudo vi config.JSON` and edit the config file, removing any additional URL information that is inaccurate. In our example, *the correct URL (after editing) is this: http://3.142.146.114:8083/environment/DEFAULT*


=== 5. Run APIM with Systemd

To start up the APIM components using systemd, run the following commands:

[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start {gravitee-package-name}-gateway {gravitee-package-name}-management-api
sudo systemctl restart nginx
----

=== 6. Confirm APIM Components Were Installed

To test that all components have been installed and started up properly, check these URLs:

|===
|Component |URL

|APIM Gateway
|http://localhost:8082/

|APIM API
|http://localhost:8083/management/organizations/DEFAULT/environments/DEFAULT/apis

|APIM Console
|http://localhost:8084/ (credentials: admin / admin)

|APIM Portal
|http://localhost:8085/

== Install APIM Package (No Dependencies)

Already have all required dependencies installed? Lucky you! You can install APIM by running the following command on your favorite terminal:

[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
sudo yum install {gravitee-package-name}
----

Now, run APIM using systemd and then confirm that all APIM components were installed, as described above.
