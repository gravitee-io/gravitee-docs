Here you will find how to configure Gravitee.io to allow users to connect using in memories accounts.


It's a basic in-memory implementation, a simple and convenient way to declare "technical" users such as the administrator users.
A good practice is to always have an admin account which can login in gravitee even if the others authentication methods are broken.
An example configuration is shown below:

[source,yaml]
----
# Authentication and identity sources
# Users can have following roles (authorities):
#  USER: Can access portal and be a member of an API
#  API_PUBLISHER: Can create and manage APIs
#  API_CONSUMER: Can create and manage Applications
#  ADMIN: Can manage global system
security:
  # When using an authentication providers, use trustAll mode for TLS connections
  # trustAll: false
  providers:  # authentication providers

      # password encoding/hashing algorithm. One of:
      # - bcrypt : passwords are hashed with bcrypt (supports only $2a$ algorithm)
