== Overview
This section describes how to configure APIM to allow users to connect using in-memory accounts.

== Example

This is a basic in-memory implementation, providing a simple and convenient way to declare _technical_ users such as administrator users.

NOTE: It is good practice to always have an administrator account which can log in to APIM even if other authentication methods are broken.
