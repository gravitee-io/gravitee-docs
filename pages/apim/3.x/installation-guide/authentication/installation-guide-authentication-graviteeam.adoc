Here you will find how to configure Gravitee.io to allow users to connect using https://gravitee.io/[Gravitee.io Access Management].

== Overview

This page explains how to configure authentication in the Gravitee.io Access Management product.

NOTE: For this guide AM 2.x (2.0.4 or above) is used.

== Create a client

Before you can connect to APIM Portal using Access Management (AM), you need to create a new client.

Refer to link:/am/2.x/am_quickstart_register_app.html[Register your first client, window="_blank"] in the AM documentation to set up your first security domain and client application.

WARNING: The `Valid Redirect URIs` value must exactly match the domain which is hosting the portal.

=== Retrieve client credentials

Once you have created your client, you will be able to retrieve its credentials.

== Test the configuration

=== Create a user in AM

Refer to link:/am/2.x/am_quickstart_register_app.html[Authenticate users with Identity Provider, window="_blank"] in the AM documentation to set up your identity provider and create your first users.

NOTE: APIM requires an `email` profile to enable portal authentication. If you create an `Inline identity provider`, you need to set an email address for the `username` field.
