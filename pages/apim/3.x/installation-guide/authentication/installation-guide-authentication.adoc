== Overview

APIM natively support multiple types of authentication for accessing APIM Portal:
* Authentication providers (such as In-memory, LDAP and databases)
* Social providers (such as GitHub and Google)
* A custom OAuth2 / OpenID authorization server

== Identity providers

You can specify as many providers as you want.
APIM API checks them in the same order you declare them in the `providers` attribute -- once a successful authentication is made, APIM API stops polling the providers.

[source,yaml]
----
security:
  providers:
    # First authentication source
    - type: ldap
      ...

    # Second authentication source
    - type: memory
      ...

    # Third authentication source
    - type: gravitee
      ...
----

NOTE: The authentication process loops through the three providers to attempt user authentication.
