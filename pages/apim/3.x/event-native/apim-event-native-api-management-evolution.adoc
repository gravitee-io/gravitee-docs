[label label-version]#New in version 3.19.0#

In this section you can learn about all the differences between the new (V4) execution engine mode and the existing V3 execution engine mode, as well as guidance on managing changes in system behavior and potential design and operational impact when switching to the new mode. The information is grouped by functional area.

== Policy execution phases/scopes and execution order

=== V3 mode

In V3 mode, different execution scopes are required in order to indicate at which level a policy will work, as follows:

* `REQUEST`: The policy only works on request headers. It never accesses the request body.
* `REQUEST_CONTENT`: The policy works at request content level and can access the request body.
* `RESPONSE`: The policy only works on response headers. It never accesses the response body.
* `RESPONSE_CONTENT`: The policy works at response content level and can access the response body.

As a result, all policies working on the body content are postponed to be executed after the policies working on headers. This leads to a different execution order than the one originally designed. This is shown in the following diagram:

=== New (V4) execution mode

In the new (V4) execution mode, the `REQUEST_CONTENT` and `RESPONSE_CONTENT` scopes (which we now call 'phases') are no longer considered - all policies are executed in the exact order of design, regardless of whether they work on the content or not. This is shown in the following diagram:

image:{% link /images/apim/3.x/event-native/event-native-api-management-execution-scopes-2.png %}[]

=== Potential impact

If you have designed your APIs with V3 execution engine mode ordering in mind and you link:{{ '/apim/3.x/apim_event_native_api_management_activate_mode.html' | relative_url }}[switch] from V3 to the new V4 execution engine mode, there may be execution behavior changes because the policy execution will be reordered to match the original design policy order.

To smooth the transition process to the new mode, you can use the debug mode to test the new behavior and adapt your APIs, so they can be safely redeployed in the new mode. For example, you can extract some information from the payload to assign it to a header.

In case of any issues or unexpected behavior, you can switch back to V3 execution mode at any time.

== Logging

=== V3 mode

In V3 mode, the following issues exist with logging:

* A 502 status code would normally indicate that the server has responded with a 502 status code, however this is not possible if the connection has failed.
* Consumer response headers were not displayed clearly.

For example:

image:{% link /images/apim/3.x/event-native/event-native-api-management-logging-1.png %}[]

=== New (V4) execution mode

In the new (V4) execution mode:

* When a connectivity error occurs during a connection attempt to the backend endpoint, the Gateway response displays an HTTP status code 0 and no headers. This makes it clear that no response has been received from the backend endpoint due to the connectivity error.
* Consumer response headers are now displayed more clearly.

For example:

image:{% link /images/apim/3.x/event-native/event-native-api-management-logging-2.png %}[]

== Condition evaluation

=== V3 mode

In V3 mode, when the Gateway provides a valid EL expression that fails to be evaluated because it is trying to access missing data, the Gateway returns a 500 error with an obscure message.

For example:

image:{% link /images/apim/3.x/event-native/event-native-api-management-condition-evaluation-1.png %}[]

=== New (V4) execution mode

In the new (V4) execution mode, when a valid EL expression is evaluated as `true`, the policy (or flow) is executed. Otherwise, it is skipped.

The policy is now skipped when:
* The EL expression is evaluated as `false`.
* The EL expression evaluation fails because the expected data tested is missing.

This is shown in the example below:

image:{% link /images/apim/3.x/event-native/event-native-api-management-condition-evaluation-2.png %}[]

Mastering EL expressions can be difficult, so the new mode ensures that if an EL expression fails because it is trying to access missing data, the condition is evaluated as `false`. This makes the use of EL expressions much simpler and easier.

For example, `{#request.headers['X-Test'][0] == 'something'}` will just skip the execution even if the request header `X-Test` is not specified.

The execution still fails and throws an error if the provided EL expression cannot be parsed (for example, if it is syntactically invalid).

The example below shows the new behavior:

image:{% link /images/apim/3.x/event-native/event-native-api-management-condition-evaluation-3.png %}[]

=== Potential impact

Conditions evaluated as errors now skip the policy or flow execution instead of returning a 500 error.

As a result, the number of 500 errors should decrease after link:{{ '/apim/3.x/apim_event_native_api_management_activate_mode.html' | relative_url }}[activation] of the new (V4) execution mode.

== Connection: close

=== V3 mode

In V3 mode, when a bad request is sent to the Gateway, the Gateway indicates a `Connection: close` response header and effectively closes the connection. The next same call from a client application will then end with the same 400 bad request code and that connection will be closed too. This could happen over again as long as the client application sends requests to the Gateway with the same invalid data. The same behavior is in place for 404 not found errors.

Creating a connection is costly for the Gateway and such issues can dramatically impact performance - especially if the consumer intensively makes a lot of bad requests.

=== New (V4) execution mode

The new execution engine considers that a bad request does not require to close the connection as it is a client-side error. The engine will only close the connection in case of a server-side error.

=== Potential impact

You can expect decreased CPU consumption in the new mode, especially when a lot of requests end with 4xx errors.


== Flow condition

=== V3 mode

In V3 mode, a condition can be defined once for the whole flow but it is evaluated before executing each phase of the flow (`REQUEST` and `RESPONSE` phases). This could lead to a partial flow execution - for instance, when trying to define a condition based on a request header and this same header is removed during the `REQUEST` phase (for example, the user does not want it to be transmitted to the backend). In such cases, the condition is re-evaluated and the `RESPONSE` phase is skipped completely. The same scenario could happen with a platform flow for the same reasons.

The example below shows this behavior:

image:{% link /images/apim/3.x/event-native/event-native-api-management-flow-condition-1.png %}[]

=== New (V4) execution mode

In the new (V4) execution mode, the flow condition will be applied once for the whole flow - if the condition is evaluated as `true`, then both the `REQUEST` and the `RESPONSE` phases will be executed.

The example below shows the new behavior:

image:{% link /images/apim/3.x/event-native/event-native-api-management-flow-condition-2.png %}[]

=== Potential impact

If you expect the `RESPONSE` phase to be skipped in the scenario described above, you must refactor your flows since both the `REQUEST` and `RESPONSE` phases will be executed as long as the condition is evaluated as `true`.

To mimic the V3 behavior while executing in the new (V4) execution mode, you can create a new flow and add a condition directly on the policies.

== Flow interruption

=== V3 mode

In V3 mode, when a policy fails, the execution flow is interrupted and the response is returned to the client application. As a result, the platform flow response is also skipped. This leads to unexpected behavior, especially when POST actions are expected (for example, for a custom metrics reporter).

The example below shows this behavior:

image:{% link /images/apim/3.x/event-native/event-native-api-management-flow-interruption-1.png %}[]

=== New (V4) execution mode

The new (V4) execution mode ensures that platform flows are always executed (except in case of an unrecoverable error). This allows the API to fail without skipping important steps in the flow occurring at a higher level.

The example below shows the new behavior:

image:{% link /images/apim/3.x/event-native/event-native-api-management-flow-interruption-2.png %}[]

== Access-Control-Allowed-Origin

=== V3 mode

In V3 mode, when configuring CORS to allow some origin, the Gateway properly validates the origin but returns `Access-Control-Allowed-Origin: *` in the response header.

=== New (V4) execution mode

In the new (V4) execution mode, the allowed origin is returned instead of `*` - for example, `Access-Control-Allowed-Origin: https://test.gravitee.io`.

The example below shows the new behavior:

image:{% link /images/apim/3.x/event-native/event-native-api-management-cors.png %}[]

== EL expression parsing

=== V3 mode

In V3 mode, the EL expression are parsed each time it is evaluated.

=== New (V4) execution mode

In the new (V4) execution mode, a new caching mechanism allows to cache the parsed EL expression for later reuse and therefore to avoid useless parsing of the same expression multiple times.

=== Potential impact

The cache of parsed EL expressions provides for enhanced performance.

== EL expression based on the body

=== V3 mode

In V3 mode, using an EL expression such as `{#request.content == 'something'}` is limited to a few policies working at `REQUEST_CONTENT` or `RESPONSE_CONTENT` - for example, assign metrics, assign content, request validation.

Defining a policy or a flow condition based on request or response body is not supported.

=== New (V4) execution mode

When the new (V4) execution mode is enabled on an API, it is possible to define a condition based on the body.

It is now possible to execute a complete flow or a policy by applying a condition on the body such as `{#request.content == 'something'}`.

Depending on the expected content type, it is also possible to define a condition based on JSON or XML content such as `{#request.jsonContent.foo.bar == 'something'}` where the request content looks like this:

....
{
	"foo": {
      "bar": "something"
    }
}
....

The same applies for XML content using `{#request.xmlContent.foo.bar == 'something'}`:

....
<foo>
  <bar>something</bar>
</foo>
....

=== Potential impact

Use with caution - using an EL body-based expression is resource-heavy and should be avoided as much as possible. Working with request or response content can significantly degrade performance and consumes substantially more memory on the Gateway.


== Policy support

=== V3 mode

In V3 mode, all existing supported policies will continue to work as before without a change.

Over time, all policies will be migrated to support the new (V4) execution engine mode. The migration will ensure that all policies are backward compatible with the V3 execution mode throughout the V3 mode's normal product support life cycle.

=== New (V4) execution mode

The new (V4) execution mode comes with a new Policy interface, which allows you to execute all existing V3-mode policies without the need for any changes.

All policies related to security have already been migrated to support both V3 and V4 execution engine modes, as follows:

* Keyless
* ApiKey
* JWT
* OAuth2

Custom policies developed by community users or customers should be perfectly compatible with the new mode, however we strongly recommend switching to the new (V4) execution engine mode implementation (a developer guide will be published soon).




== Timeout Management

=== V3 mode

In V3 mode, when a timeout is configured (`http.requestTimeout`) and triggered due to a request that is too slow (or a policy taking too much time to execute, such as an http callout policy), the API platform flows are skipped and a 504 status is sent as a response to the client.

=== New (V4) execution mode

In the new (V4) execution mode, values of 0 and less are treated as meaning 'no timeout' (like in V3 mode). If you configure the timeout with a positive value, then it will act normally.

NOTE: If no configuration is provided, a default configuration is set to default to 30 000ms timeout.

Timeout can now be triggered on two places in the chain, as follows:

* The flow can be interrupted between the beginning of the request and the end of response API flow. In this case, a platform response flow will be executed.
* The flow can be interrupted during the platform response flow, because the overall request time is too big, causing a 504 response and getting the platform response flow interrupted.

Two properties are available to address this:
* `http.requestTimeout` - the duration used to configure the timeout of the request.
* `http.requestTimeoutGraceDelay` - an additional time used to give the platform response flow a chance to execute.

The timeout value is calculated from those two properties:
* `Timeout = Max(http.requestTimeoutGraceDelay, http.requestTimeout - apiElapsedTime)`
* With `apiElapsedTime = System.currentTimeMillis() - request().timestamp()`.

==== Examples

NOTE: In the following examples we assume that there is no timeout defined for the backend in the API's endpoint configuration. In real life, those timeout values should be shorter than `http.requestTimeout`, and should interrupt the flow at invoker level.

We will use `http.requestTimeout=2000ms` and `http.requestTimeoutGraceDelay=30ms`.

The example below shows timelines indicating when a timeout should occur depending on the duration of the API flow and the response platform flows:

== Plan selection


=== Common behavior

The plan selection workflow parses all the published plans in the following order: JWT, Oauth2, ApiKey, Keyless.

The parsed plan is selected for execution if all the following conditions are met:
* The request contains a token corresponding to this plan type (api-key header, authorization header).
* The plan condition rule is either not set or set but not truthy.
* There is an active subscription matching the incoming request.

=== V3 mode

In V3 mode, the Oauth2 plan *is selected* even if the incoming request does not match a subscription.

No JWT token introspection is done during Oauth2 plan selection.

If there are multiple Oauth2 plans, that would lead to the selection of an irrelevant one.

=== New (V4) execution mode

In the new (V4) execution mode, the Oauth2 plan *is not selected* if the incoming request does not match a subscription.

During the Oauth2 plan selection, a token introspection is released in order to retrieve the `client_id`, which allows searching for a subscription.

Due to concerns about performance, a cache system is available to avoid doing the same token introspection multiple times.

If possible, we encourage using selection rules if there are multiple Oauth2 plans, in order to avoid any unnecessary token introspection.

NOTE: The policy has been changed for the Keyless plan - its activation is now prevented in case a security token has been detected in the incoming request by one of the previous plans. Therefore, if an API has multiple plans (JWT, Oauth2, Apikey, Keyless) and the incoming request contains a token or an apikey that does not match any of the existing plans, then the Keyless plan will not be activated and the user will receive a generic 401 response without any details.
