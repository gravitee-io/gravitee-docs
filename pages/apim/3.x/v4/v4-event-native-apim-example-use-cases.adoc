[label label-version]#New in version 3.20.0#

[NOTE]
====
This document assumes you are familiar with synchronous APIs, asynchronous APIs, and the OpenAPI specification.
====


This page describes some example use cases for event-native API management.

== Prerequisites

You need to have a running instance of APIM and a running instance of AKHQ to run these examples.

The examples on this page work best if you are using Docker.

[TIP]
====
When you use Docker as described below, two Docker bridge networks are created: `frontend` and `storage`. AKHQ must run on the `storage` network. 

If you are not using Docker, you must make sure that the APIM components can connect to the Kafka bootstrap server.

* link:{{'/apim/3.x/event_native_tutorials_akhq.html' | relative_url}}[Installing AKHQ]

=== Without Docker

==== Kafka

These examples depend on having a Kafka bootstrap server on host `kafka` and port `9092`. If your Kafka bootstrap server is on another host or port, you must update the request bodies of all "Create API" requests in the Postman Collection.

For example, in the "Kafka" > "Create API" you should change line 36 of the request body to use your values.

[code,json]
----
                        "bootstrapServers": "kafka:9092",
----

====  Enabling event-native API management

To run these examples, you must enable the link:{{'/apim/3.x/v4_new_policy_execution_engine_introduction.html#how_to_enable_and_disable_the_new_engine' | relative_url }}[new V4 policy execution engine] first by setting the `gravitee_api_jupiterMode_enabled` environment variable to `true` on the Management API and the API Gateway.

NOTE: See link:{{'/apim/3.x/apim_installguide_rest_apis_configuration.html#environment_variables' | relative_url }}[Environment variables] on the Management API and link:{{'/apim/3.x/apim_installguide_gateway_configuration.html#environment_variables' | relative_url }}[Environment variables] on the API Gateway for more detail about setting environment variables.

=== V4 3.20.x Postman Collection

These examples use the Gravitee V4 3.20.x Postman Collection, available from the link:https://www.postman.com/gravitee-io/workspace/gravitee-public-workspace/overview[Gravitee Public Workspace] in Postman.

This collection uses the following four variables.

[cols="1,1,1", options="header"]
|===
| Variable
| Description
| Example

| `management_host`
| The host for the Management API
| `http://localhost:8083`

| `management_username`
| The username for a management user
| `admin`

| `management_password`
| The password for `management_username`
|

| `gateway_host`
| The gateway host
| `http://loalhost:8082`
|===

== Data ingestion

Some data ingestion examples are illustrated in the following diagram.

image:{% link /images/apim/3.x/event-native/event-native-api-management-data-ingestion.png %}[]

For data ingestion, run the requests in the _01 - Data Ingestion_ folder of the Postman Collection.

You can also use `curl` to `POST` data to the endpoint, as shown in the example below.

[source bash]
----
curl -X POST -d "my_payload" http://localhost:8082/data/ingestion
----

== Event consumption

=== Streaming: server-sent events (SSE)

For streaming with server-sent events (SSE), run the requests in the _02 - Event Consumption - SSE_ folder of the Postman Collection.

You can test it with `curl`.

[source bash]
----
curl -N -H "Accept:text/event-stream" http://localhost:8082/demo/sse
----

=== Streaming: WebSocket

For streaming with WebSocket, run the requests in the _03 - Event Consumption - Websocket_ folder of the Postman Collection.

You can test it through a WebSocket connection in Postman, or you can use the `websocat` command-line tool as shown in the example below.

[source bash]
----
websocat ws://localhost:8082/demo/ws
----

=== Webhooks

For webhooks, run the requests in the _04 - Event Consumption - Webhook_ folder of the Postman Collection.

This request group uses a webhook callback that is called by the API Gateway. The unique callback URL is generated via https://webhook.site/.

To use these requests, go to https://webhook.site/ to get your unique callback URL, and update the Postman Collection to use it. For example:

[source json]
----
{
    "configuration": {
        "type": "webhook",
        "callbackUrl": "https://webhook.site/891490b9-1e37-4b5e-8f91-4d40b9187710"
    }
}
----

==== Webhooks with subscription filter

For webhooks with subscription filters, run the requests in the _05 - Event Consumption - Webhook - Message Filtering_ folder of the Postman Collection.

Use the following policy configuration.

[source json]
----
 {
  "name": "Message filtering",
  "description": "Apply filter to messages",
  "enabled": true,
  "policy": "message-filtering",
  "configuration": {
    "filter": "{#jsonPath(#message.content, '$.feature') == #subscription.metadata.feature}"
  }
}
----
