== Event-driven asynchronous APIs

Most developers are familiar with synchronous APIs, where the client sends a request to a server, and the server sends a response back. Every time the client needs new data, it has to send a request. You can think of synchronous APIs as a 'client pull' model.

In contrast, asynchronous APIs are event-driven - the initial request opens a connection and data (responses) is received back as and when it becomes available, where certain events would trigger the responses. Asynchronous APIs also allow you to stream data - a common use case in banking and finance systems and applications, as well as many other domains. Asynchronous APIs can use callbacks (such as synchronous API webhooks) if the requested data is not available at the time of the request. You can think of asynchronous APIs as a 'publish and subscribe' model.

== Gravitee's event-native API management

With the rise of cloud computing, many vendors started to build their solutions for the cloud. Rather than taking on-premises software and converting it to work as SaaS, it was built from the ground to to be cloud-based. These solutions are said to be cloud-native.

Event-native API management is similar. Rather than taking a synchronous API management solution and converting it to handle event-driven APIs, an event-native API management solution is built from the ground up to handle event-driven APIs.


Gravitee's API management solution can run in event-native mode, and it can support all asynchronous use cases, such as streaming or event-driven APIs. Of course, Gravitee's API management solution also supports synchronous use cases.

Gravitee can act as a bridge between synchronous and asynchronous APIs.

For example, Gravitee can subscribe to a Kafka topic and then allow filtered HTTP GET subscriptions from clients as shown in the following diagram.

=== WebSocket and SSE entrypoints

The Server-Sent Events (SSE) and WebSocket entrypoints are available as separate plugins you can download from the link:https://download.gravitee.io/#graviteeio-apim/plugins/entrypoints/[entrypoints plugin download page]. Please note that you need an Enterprise Edition (EE) license to use the SSE Advanced entrypoint capabilities. 

This feature enables you to front your event-driven backend - currently only using Kafka or the MQTT5 connectors  - with Websocket or Server-Sent Events (SSE) so that API consumers can access events from the Kafka backend via one of these more consumer-friendly protocols.

For example, if an API consumer cannot connect to a native Kafka instance due to technical limitations (for example, if they cannot implement a Kafka client themselves), Kafka topics can be made available to that consumer via a more consumer-friendly protocol such as SSE or Websocket.

The diagram below shows the workflow for this use case:

This feature enables you to potentially cover use cases in the fields of Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) and Internet of Things (IoT) without the Gateway and API Management components becoming a bottleneck.

NOTE: In comparison to the link:#http_post_and_http_get_entrypoints[HTTP POST entrypoint use case] using Kafka (where the HTTP POST method is just about sending information from the client app to Kafka), with Websocket it is possible for the client app to send and receive information from Kafka as well. SSE can consume information from Kafka.

== Security

Gravitee can still provide the same security as in previous versions. You can secure access using an API key, JWT, or OAuth.
