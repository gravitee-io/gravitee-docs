Gravitee API Management is based mainly on the HTTP protocol, but data can also be consumed by subscription. It has two types of listener: `HTTP` and `SUBSCRIPTION`.

* `HTTP`: this is the most common type of listener. Most synchronous and asynchronous APIs use this listener and consume data over HTTP.
* `SUBSCRIPTION`:  this type of listener is used for specific APIs. It is particularly useful for Webhook which requires the gateway to accept a subscription to start consuming messages from an endpoint and send them to an external Webhook.
