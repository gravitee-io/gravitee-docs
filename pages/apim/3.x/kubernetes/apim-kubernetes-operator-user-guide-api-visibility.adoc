[label label-version]#New in version 3.21.0#

== Introduction

This section will provide you with a guide for deploying an API on Gateway(s) in different Kubernetes clusters. The guide will cover both single and multiple Gateway deployment scenarios.

== Overview
The Gravitee Gateways will be deployed in different clusters and the Management API will be deployed in the same cluster as the Gravitee Kubernetes Operator.

== Deploy on a single Gateway

In this scenario, we will deploy an API on a single Gateway. To do it, we will apply the following configuration, on the Gateway 1 cluster:

[,yaml]
----
apiVersion: gravitee.io/v1alpha1
kind: ApiDefinition
metadata:
  name: local-api-example
spec:
  name: "GKO Basic"
  version: "1.1"
  description: "Basic api managed by Gravitee Kubernetes Operator"
  proxy:
    virtual_hosts:
      - path: "/k8s-basic"
    groups:
      - endpoints:
          - name: "Default"
            target: "https://api.gravitee.io/echo"
  local: true
----

Here we notice that the `local` field is set to `true`. This field is used to indicate that the API will be deployed only in the cluster where the custom resource is applied. The `local` field is optional and is set to `true` by default. Running the following command we can check that the API ConfigMap has been created in the Gateway 1 cluster:

[source,bash]
----
$ kubectl get cm -n gateway-1-cluster
----

----
NAMESPACE            NAME                DATA    AGE
gateway-1-namespace  local-api-example   1       1m
----

== Deploy on multiple Gateways

In this scenario, we will deploy an API on multiple Gateways. To do it, we will use a custom resource that can be applied to any cluster, as long as the Management API is available, the ApiDefinition refers to a ManagementContext and the `local` field is set to `false`.

[,yaml]
----
apiVersion: gravitee.io/v1alpha1
kind: ApiDefinition
metadata:
  name: global-api-example
spec:
  name: "GKO Basic"
  version: "1.1"
  description: "Basic api managed by Gravitee Kubernetes Operator"
  contextRef:
    name: apim-example-context
    namespace: apim-example
  proxy:
    virtual_hosts:
      - path: "/k8s-basic"
    groups:
      - endpoints:
          - name: "Default"
            target: "https://api.gravitee.io/echo"
  local: false
----

Running the following command, you should not find any ConfigMap linked to our ApiDefinition in the cluster where the custom resource has been applied.

[source,bash]
----
$ kubectl get cm --all-namespaces
----

Indeed, the ApiDefinition has been deployed using the Management API and the ApiDefinition is not local to the cluster.
