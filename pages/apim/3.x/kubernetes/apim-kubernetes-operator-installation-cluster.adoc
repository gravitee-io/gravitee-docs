== Overview

This section provides steps on how to deploy the Gravitee Kubernetes Operator (GKO) on an existing APIM-ready Kubernetes cluster.

NOTE: If you do not have an existing cluster you can deploy to, you can set up a new local cluster - see the link:{{ '/apim/3.x/apim_kubernetes_operator_installation_local.html' | relative_url }}[local cluster installation section] for details. Once you have the local cluster set up and running, return to this section to deploy the GKO.

NOTE: If your architecture requires the management of multiple Kubernetes clusters with a different set of APIs for each cluster, you should deploy the GKO separately on each cluster. Follow the deployment process described below for each cluster deployment.

== Prerequisites

Before you start the deployment process, ensure that you have access to an APIM-ready Kubernetes cluster.

It is also recommended to check the current Kubernetes context to ensure that it is set to the correct cluster. To do this, run the following command:

....
kubectl config current-context
....

NOTE: See the link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/cheatsheet/#kubectl-context-and-configuration[Kubernetes documentation^] for more information on displaying a list of contexts and setting your current context.

== Deploying the GKO on the cluster

=== STEP 1: Run the deployment script

Run the following command in your command-line tool (the working directory does not matter) to deploy the GKO on the cluster of your current Kubernetes context:

....
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/gravitee-io/gravitee-kubernetes-operator/releases/download/latest/bundle.yml
....

The operation is quick and the successful command-line output should be similar to one in the example below:

....
namespace/gko-system created
customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/apidefinitions.gravitee.io created
customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/managementcontexts.gravitee.io created
serviceaccount/gko-controller-manager created
role.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/gko-leader-election-role created
clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/gko-manager-role created
clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/gko-metrics-reader created
clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/gko-proxy-role created
rolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/gko-leader-election-rolebinding created
clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/gko-manager-rolebinding created
clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/gko-proxy-rolebinding created
configmap/gko-manager-config created
service/gko-controller-manager-metrics-service created
deployment.apps/gko-controller-manager created
....

The GKO has now been deployed on your cluster.

=== STEP 2: Check if the Gravitee CRDs are available on your cluster

Run the following command:

....
kubectl get crd
....

The command-line output should include `apidefinitions.gravitee.io` and `managementcontexts.gravitee.io`, as shown in the example below:

....

....
