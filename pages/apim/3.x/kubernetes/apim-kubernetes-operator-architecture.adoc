== About Gravitee Kubernetes Operators

A link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/[Kubernetes operator^] is a method of packaging, deploying, and managing a Kubernetes application. A Kubernetes application is both deployed on Kubernetes and managed using the Kubernetes API and `kubectl` tooling.

In this context, a Kubernetes operator is an application-specific controller that extends the functionality of the Kubernetes API to create, configure, and manage application instances.

== Architecture overview

The current functionality of the Gravitee Kubernetes Operator (GKO) allows for three main deployment scenarios, as described below.

NOTE: To learn how to deploy GKO on a remote cluster, see the link:{{ '/apim/3.x/apim_kubernetes_operator_installation_cluster.html' | relative_url }}[Remote cluster deployment] section.

=== Standard deployment

In the standard deployment scenario, the Management API and the API Gateway are deployed in the same Kubernetes cluster.

With this workflow, the GKO listens for link:{{ '/apim/3.x/apim_kubernetes_operator_definitions.html' | relative_url }}[Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs]. For each custom resource, an API is pushed to the Management API using the import endpoint. The API Gateway deploys the APIs accordingly.

The following diagram illustrates the standard deployment architectural approach:

=== Deployment on multiple clusters

In this scenario, the assimption is that both of the following requirements should be met:

1. The user manages multiple Kubernetes clusters with a different set of APIs for each cluster.
2. All APIs are managed using a single API Console.

To make this work with GKO, it should be installed on all the required clusters.

The following diagram illustrates the multi-cluster deployment architectural approach:

=== Deployment on multiple environments

In this scenario, a single GKO is deployed that can publish APIs to different environments (logical or physical). This is managed directly from the link:{{ '/apim/3.x/apim_kubernetes_operator_user_guide_api_definition.html' | relative_url }}[API Definition] custom resource, which refers a link:{{ '/apim/3.x/apim_kubernetes_operator_user_guide_api_context.html' | relative_url }}[Management Context] custom resource.

NOTE: Note that in this case different APIs are published on each of the environments. This is because APIs use the `ManagementContext` CRD, which can reference any Management API, however an `ApiDefinition` CRD can only have one Management Context.

The following diagram illustrates the multi-environment deployment architectural approach:
