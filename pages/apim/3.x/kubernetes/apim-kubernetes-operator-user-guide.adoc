[label label-version]#New in version 3.19.0#
[label label-version]#BETA release#

In this section you can learn how to work with CRDs and how to synchronize your API CRDs with an existing management API, including how to start, stop, update, and delete your APIs - all this with examples.

The Gravitee Kubernetes Operator comes with three Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) - `ApiContext`, `ApiDefinition`, and `ApiResource`. They are described in detail further in this section.

NOTE: The GKO only works with APIM version 3.19.0 (and above).
