== What is an application?

Consumers who want to use APIs need to register an application that will allow API publishers to control and regulate access to their APIs.
Typical applications are web applications, native applications or bash/job applications which access data.

You can manage applications in both APIM Console and APIM Portal.

== Prerequisites

To create applications, you need to enable the correct options in the *Settings > Client registration* page.

To create a simple application, enable the *Simple* option in the *Allowed application types* section:

To create browser, web, native or backend-to-backend applications:

* define at least one client registration provider
* enable the following options:

== Create an application

NOTE: Only users with the required permissions can create an application. For more details, see the link:{{ '/apim/3.x/apim_adminguide_roles_and_permissions.html' | relative_url }}[Roles and permissions] section of the Administration Guide.

. Log in to APIM Portal.
. Click *Dashboard* in the top menu.
. Click the *CREATE AN APPLICATION* button.
+

. Enter the application name and description, and upload an image, if required. Click *NEXT*.
+

. (Optional) If you want to subscribe to an API's OAuth 2.0/JWT plan and you have an OAuth 2.0 client, make a note of your *client_id* and complete the security part.
. Select the type of application and complete the details. Click *NEXT*.

. (Optional) Search for an API and request a subscription (see link:{{ '/apim/3.x/apim_quickstart_consume_ui.html' | relative_url }}[Consume an API with APIM Portal]) in the Quick Start Guide. Click *NEXT*.
. Check your application information in the summary, then click *CREATE THE APP*.

NOTE:  If the selected plan requires the acceptance of general conditions, these will be displayed on the right.

Congratulations! Your new application has been created.

== Manage members

When a new application is created, only the application's creator (PRIMARY OWNER) can see and manage the application.
Most of the time an application is shared through a developer application and will retrieve information such as API keys and API analytics.

By default, APIM includes three membership roles:

[cols="2*", options="header"]
|===
^|Role
^|Description

.^| *Primary owner*
.^| When an application is created, the primary owner is the creator of the applcation. Primary owner can do all possible actions for an API.

.^| *Owner*
.^| Owner is a lightest version of the primary owner role. Owner can do all possible actions except delete the application.

.^| *User*
.^| A user is a person who can access the application in read only mode and use the application to subscribe to an API.

|===

NOTE: Only users with the required permissions can manage application members. For more details, see the link:{{ '/apim/3.x/apim_adminguide_roles_and_permissions.html' | relative_url }}[Roles and permissions] section of the Administration Guide.

To manage members:

. Log in to APIM Portal.
. Click *Applications* in the top menu.
. In the *Applications* screen, select your application and go to the *Members* page.

=== Add and remove users
You can add new users by searching for them:

image::apim/3.x/api-consumer-guide/developer-manage/manage-members-add.png[]

You can remove users by clicking the trash icon:

image::apim/3.x/api-consumer-guide/developer-manage/manage-members-remove.png[]

=== Transfer ownership
You can transfer ownership to another user, when the current primary owner leaves the project, for example.

image::apim/3.x/api-consumer-guide/developer-manage/manage-members-transfer-ownership.png[]

== Manage subscriptions

Subscriptions represent the plans the application has subscribed to. In the Subscriptions page, application members can see if their access to the APIs is still valid, has not been revoked or is in the API publisher approval process.

image::apim/3.x/api-consumer-guide/developer-manage/app-subscriptions.png[]

== Analytics

For each API you have subscribed to, APIM provides some analytics to show API usage in your application.

The table below lists the analytics available.

|===
|Analytics|Description

|Top API
|Top APIs sorted by the number of API calls

|Status
|HTTP status distribution summary

|Top paths
|Hits by path

|Top mapped paths
|Hits by mapped path

|Response status
|Hits by status

|Response times
|Average response time

|Hits by API
|Hits by API

== Restore an archived application

When a user deletes an application, it is in `ARCHIVED` status.

It means that:

- The link to the primary owner of the application is deleted.

- The subscriptions are closed. In case of subscription to an API-Key plan, the keys are revoked.

- Notification settings are deleted.

As an `ADMIN`, you can restore application in the APIM Console.

The `ADMIN` user will become the primary owner of the application.

NOTE: Every application's subscriptions will be restored in `PENDING` status. The API publisher will have to reactivate manually the needed subscriptions.
