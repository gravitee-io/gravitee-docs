Gravitee.io allows user to manage his or her applications from the portal and the console.

== What is an application ?

Consumers who want to use APIs need to register an application that will let API publishers to control and regulate access to their APIs.
Typically application can be a web application, a native application, bash/job applications and so on which want to access data.

== Prerequisites

In order to create simple applications, this option has to be enabled in *Settings > Client Registration*:

In order to create Browser, Web, Native or Backend-to-backend applications:

* At least one Client Registration provider must be defined

== Manage members

When an application is registered only the application's creator (PRIMARY OWNER) can see and manage the application.

Most of the time an application will be share across the developers' application and they will ask access for an application to get information such as API keys and API analytics.

By default, Gravitee.io is defining three roles for membership:

[cols="2*", options="header"]
|===
^|Role
^|Description

.^| *Primary owner*
.^| When an application is created, the primary owner is the creator of the applcation. Primary owner can do all possible actions for an API.

.^| *Owner*
.^| Owner is a lightest version of the primary owner role. Owner can do all possible actions except delete the application.

.^| *User*
.^| A user is a person who can access the application in read only mode and use the application to subscribe to an API.

|===
