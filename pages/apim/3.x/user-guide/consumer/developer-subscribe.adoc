== Overview
APIM Portal exposes published APIs to developers so they can browse the APIs, request access, generate subscriptions to secure access and identify consumers for monitoring and analytics.

To access the APIs and start interacting with them, consumers must first subscribe to an link:{{ '/apim/3.x/apim_publisherguide_plans_subscriptions.html' | relative_url }}[API plan] with their registered application.

NOTE: Consumers must have a link:{{ '/apim/3.x/apim_consumerguide_create_account.html' | relative_url }}[user account] to register an application and subscribe to an API.

=== Plan security type

Depending on the plan security type (API-Key, OAuth 2.0, JWT), you need to set proper HTTP headers to call the API (for more details, see <<apim_publisherguide_plans_subscriptions.adoc#create-a-plan, Create a plan>>).

**API Key**

----
curl -X GET "https://api.company.com/amazing-api" -H "X-Gravitee-Api-Key: xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx"
----

**OAuth 2.0/JWT**

NOTE: You need to get an access token from the authorization server before you can consume the API.

----
curl -X GET "https://api.company.com/amazing-api" -H "Authorization: Bearer xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx"
----

== Create an application

Consumers wanting to subscribe to APIs need to register an application first, so that API publishers can control and regulate access to their APIs.
Applications can be web applications, native application, bash/job applications and other applications needing to access sensitive data.

For more information, see <<apim_quickstart_consume_ui.adoc#create-your-application-with-apim-portal, Create your application with APIM Portal>>.

[NOTE]
====
If there are general conditions for the selected plan, you need to accept them before validating the subscription.

====
+
If validation is automatic, the following message is displayed:
+
image::{% link images/apim/3.x/api-consumer-guide/developer-subscribe/subscribe-validation.png %}[]
+
If the API publisher chose to manually validate application subscriptions, you must await approval to use the API.

== Manage subscriptions

To view your subscriptions and their current status:

. Go to the *Applications* page.
. Choose an application. In the *Subscriptions* section you will see all your subscriptions with their status (for example, *Accepted* or *Pending*).
. Click on a specific subscription to see the details.

NOTE: For API-Key plans, you can retrieve the API-Key value and also renew or revoke subscriptions.

== Analytics

For each API you are subscribed to, APIM provides some analytics to show API usage in your application. For a list of the analytics available, see <<apim_consumerguide_manage_applications.adoc#analytics, Analytics>>.
