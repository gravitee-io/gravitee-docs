Gravitee.io Portal exposes published APIs to let application developers browsing APIs,
requesting access and generating subscriptions to secure access and identify consumers for monitoring and analytics.

To access these APIs and start playing with, consumers must subscribe to the link:/apim/3.x/apim_publisherguide_plans_subscriptions.html[APIs' plans] with their registered application.

NOTE: Consumers must have a link:/apim/3.x/apim_consumerguide_create_account.html[user account] to register an application and subscribe to an API.

== Create an application
Consumers who want to use APIs need to register an application that will let API publishers to control and regulate access to their APIs.
Typically, application can be a web application, a native application, bash/job applications and so on which want to access sensitive data.

See link:/apim/3.x/apim_consumerguide_manage_applications.html#create_an_application[how to create your first application]

== Subscribe to an API

API's plans allow API publisher to provide and regulate access to their APIs. In order to use APIs, you must subscribe to an API's plan (see link:/apim/3.x/apim_publisherguide_plans_subscriptions.html[plans and subscriptions]).

[start=10]
. If validation is automatic, you will get this message:

Depending on the plan security type (API-Key, OAuth 2.0, JWT), you need to set proper HTTP headers to call the API.

**API Key**

----
curl -X GET "https://api.company.com/amazing-api" -H "X-Gravitee-Api-Key: xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx"
----

**OAuth 2.0/JWT**

You have to get an access_token from the authorization server before being able to consume this API.

----
curl -X GET "https://api.company.com/amazing-api" -H "Authorization: Bearer xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx"
----

[NOTE]
====
If the API's publisher choose to manually validate application subscriptions, you must wait his approval to use the API.
