Gravitee.io APIM allows you to create custom user roles to fit your needs.
A role is a group of permissions and has a scope.
Roles define what you can do with the UI and also with the REST API.

Before defining some key concepts, please have a look at the new link:/apim/3.x/apim_adminguide_organizations_and_environments.html[*Gravitee.io Platform* design].

== Glossary
=== Scope
As described in the [Organizations and Environments] page, an environment is barely equivalent to what you can find in Gravitee.io Portal.
To be more precise,the *Environment* scope gathers all actions that can be done related to this concept, from the APIM Portal as well as the APIM Console.
For instance:
 * APIs management is possible in APIM Console for API Publishers
 * Applications management is possible in both APIM Console and APIM Portal.
 * APIs ratings is possible in APIM Portal for API Consumers.

The *Organization* scope concerns (obviously) all that is related to the organization: i.e. users, roles, ... Theses action are only available in APIM Console.

*A user can more than one `ORGANIZATION` role and more than one `ENVIRONMENT` role per environment.*

Scopes `API` and `APPLICATION` are slightly different.

As an API publisher or consumer, you will have access to APIs and/or Applications.
Gravitee.io allows you to have a different role on every single API and Applications.
Sometimes you are the owner, sometimes a simple user or the person in charge of writing the documentation.
This means that the `API` / `APPLICATION` role makes sense only when it is associated with and API / Application.

=== Role
A role is a functional group of permissions.
There is no limit on the number of roles you're allowed to create.
But don't forget that you need to administrate them ðŸ™‚.

Some roles are specials. The are tagged as `System` or `Default`.

==== System Role
A System Role is a read-only role (i.e. you cannot change permissions) needs by Gravitee.io.
It's the `ADMIN` role scoped `ENVIRONMENT` and `ORGANIZATION`, and the `PRIMARY_OWNER` role scoped `API` and `APPLICATION`.
They give user all permissions.

==== Default Role
A Default Role is a role used by Gravitee.io when a role is not specified.
For example, the default `ENVIRONMENT` and `ORGANIZATION` roles are set to a new registered user.
This is a role with the lower permissions.

You can change the default on each scope.

=== Permission
A permission a list of actions allowed on a resource. The actions are `Create`, `Read`, `Update` and `Delete`.

Here is the list of permissions by scope

== How to create a custom role.
Let say that we want to create a writer role which allow a user to create documentation on APIs.

=== Create the `WRITER` role
To do that, click `ADD A NEW ROLE` button in the `Settings > Roles` menu

.Create
image::apim/3.x/adminguide/newrole-create.png[Gravitee.io - Create a New Role]

=== Configure the `WRITER` role
You must give `READ` permission on the `DEFINITION` and `GATEWAY_DEFINITION`.
This allow the user to see the API in the api list.
Next, you have to give `CRUD` permission on the DOCUMENTATION.

.Configure
image::apim/3.x/adminguide/newrole-configure.png[Gravitee.io - Configure a New Role]

=== Result
As expected, the user with this role can now only see the documentation menu.

.Menu

NOTE: Granting a GROUP permission for MANAGEMENT role will also require the READ operation for the ROLE permission in order to see which roles are provided by a group.
