== Overview
APIM allows you to create custom user roles to fit your needs.

A role:
- Is associated with a group of permissions
- Has a scope
- Defines what you can do with the APIM UI components and APIM API

Before defining some key concepts, we recommend you first take a look at the new link:/apim/3.x/apim_adminguide_organizations_and_environments.html[*Gravitee.io Platform* design].

NOTE: Any changes may take a short time to be applied to a user.

=== Scopes

Roles are defined in terms of _scopes_. As described in the link:/apim/3.x/apim_adminguide_organizations_and_environments.html[Organizations and environments] page, an _environment_ is roughly equivalent to what you can find in APIM Portal.
To be more precise, an environment's scope is all of the actions that can be performed in the specific context, in APIM Portal and APIM Management.

For example:
 * APIs can be managed by API publishers in APIM Management
 * Applications can be managed in both APIM Management and APIM Portal.
 * API rating can be managed by API consumers in APIM Portal

As the name suggests, the scope of an _organization_ is all aspects of an organization: users, roles, and so on. These actions are only available in APIM Management.

NOTE: A user can have more than one organization role and more than one environment role in an environment.

The scopes of _API_ and _application_ work slightly differently.

As an API publisher or consumer, you have access to APIs and/or applications.
APIM allows you to have a different role in each API and application.
Sometimes you are the owner, sometimes an ordinary user, sometimes the person in charge of writing the documentation.
This means that the API and application roles only have a meaning in terms of their association with am API or application.

=== Role
A role is a functional group of permissions.
There is no limit to the number of roles you can create.
They all need to be administered, however.

Some roles are special. The are tagged as `System` or `Default`.

==== System role
The System role is a read-only role (i.e. you cannot change permissions) used by APIM.
It is both an `ADMIN` role with an `ENVIRONMENT` and `ORGANIZATION` scope, and a `PRIMARY_OWNER` role with an `API` and `APPLICATION` scope.
It gives the user all permissions.

==== Default role
The Default role is the role used by APIM when a role is not specified.
For example, the default `ENVIRONMENT` and `ORGANIZATION` roles are set to a new registered user.
This is a role with less permissions.

You can change the default on each scope.

=== Permission
A permission a list of actions allowed on a resource. The actions are `Create`, `Read`, `Update` and `Delete`.

The list of permissions by scope is as follows:

== Create a custom role
In this example, we will create a writer role which allows a user to create API documentation.

=== Create the `WRITER` role
Click *ADD A NEW ROLE* in the APIM Management *Settings > Roles* menu.

image::apim/3.x/adminguide/newrole-create.png[Gravitee.io - Create a New Role]

=== Configure the `WRITER` role
You must give `READ` permissions on `DEFINITION` and `GATEWAY_DEFINITION`.
This allows the user to see the API in the API list.
Next, you need to give `CRUD` permissions on `DOCUMENTATION`.

image::apim/3.x/adminguide/newrole-configure.png[Gravitee.io - Configure a New Role]

=== Result
The user with this role can now only see the documentation menu.

NOTE: Granting a `GROUP` permission to the `MANAGEMENT` role also requires the `READ` operation for the `ROLE` permission in order to see which roles are provided by a group.
