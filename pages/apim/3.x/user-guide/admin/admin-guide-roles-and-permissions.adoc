== Overview

APIM allows you to create custom user roles to fit your needs. Some default roles are provided for you.

In APIM, a role:

- is associated with a group of permissions
- has a scope
- defines what you can do with the APIM UI components and APIM API

Before defining some key concepts, we recommend you first take a look at the new link:/apim/3.x/apim_adminguide_organizations_and_environments.html[Gravitee.io Platform design^].

NOTE: Any changes to a role may take a short time to be applied to a user.

[[scope]]
=== Scopes

Roles are defined in terms of _scopes_. As described in the link:/apim/3.x/apim_adminguide_organizations_and_environments.html[Organizations and environments] page, an _environment_ corresponds roughly to what you can find in APIM Portal.
More precisely, an environment's scope is all of the actions that can be performed in the specific context, whether in APIM Portal or APIM Console.

For example:

 * APIs can be managed by API publishers in APIM Console.
 * Applications can be managed in both APIM Console and APIM Portal.
 * API ratings can be managed by API consumers in APIM Portal.

As the name suggests, the scope of an _organization_ is all aspects of an organization: users, roles, and so on. Organization-level actions are only available in APIM Console.

NOTE: A user can have more than one organization role and more than one environment role.

The scopes of _API_ and _application_ work slightly differently.

As an API publisher or consumer, you have access to APIs and/or applications.
APIM allows you to have a different role for each API and application.
You can be the owner for one, an ordinary user for another and the person in charge of writing the documentation for another.
This means that the API and application roles are only meaningful in terms of their association with an API or application.

=== Role
A role is a functional group of permissions.
There is no limit to the number of roles you can create.
They all need to be administered, however.

Some roles are special. The are tagged as `System` or `Default`.

==== System role
The System role is a read-only role (i.e. you cannot change its permissions) used by APIM.
It is both an `ADMIN` role with an `ENVIRONMENT` and `ORGANIZATION` scope, and a `PRIMARY_OWNER` role with an `API` and `APPLICATION` scope.
The System role gives the user all permissions.

==== Default role
The Default role is the role used by APIM when a role is not specified.
For example, new registered users are assigned the default `ENVIRONMENT` and `ORGANIZATION`.
The Default role gives the user limited permissions.

You can change the default on each scope.

=== Permission
A permission is a list of actions allowed on a resource. The actions are `Create`, `Read`, `Update` and `Delete`.

The list of permissions by scope is as follows:

.`ENVIRONMENT` scope permissions

== Create a custom role
In this example, we will create a writer role which allows a user to create API documentation.

=== Create the `WRITER` role

. link:/apim/3.x/apim_quickstart_console_login.html[Log in to APIM Console].
. In the *Organization Settings > Roles* page, click *ADD A NEW ROLE*.
+

=== Configure the `WRITER` role

Assign the following permissions to the writer role:

* `READ` permissions on `DEFINITION` and `GATEWAY_DEFINITION` -- this allows the user to see the API in the API list
* `CRUD` permissions on `DOCUMENTATION`

image::apim/3.x/adminguide/newrole-configure.png[Gravitee.io - Configure a New Role]

=== Result
Users with this role can now only see the documentation menu.

NOTE: Granting `GROUP` permissions to the `MANAGEMENT` role also requires the `READ` operation for the `ROLE` permission in order to see which roles are provided by a group.
