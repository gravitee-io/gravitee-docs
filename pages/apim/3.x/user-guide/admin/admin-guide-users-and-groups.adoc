== Users

In the installation guide, you have learnt how to configure different identity providers (see link:/apim/3.x/apim_installguide_authentication.html[how to configure authentication]).

Users are listed in the `Users` section of the `Settings` menu.

image::apim/3.x/adminguide/usersgroups-users.png[Gravitee.io - List users]

Here you can :

 * remove a user account (only if the user is not a primary owner of an api or an application),
 * reset its password (only for users created with the Gravitee form)

If you select a user, you have access to a detailed information about its account and permissions and the ability to manage its groups.

== User Fields

If you allow a new user to signing up, you have the capability to request additional fields during the registration process.

To configure the list custom fields, go to the "User Fields" menu and Click on the (+) button.

image::apim/3.x/adminguide/custom-user-fields-list.png[Gravitee.io - User Fields]

The dialog box will ask you some inputs:

	* The field key: this is the field identifier, it is used to translate the label in the portal UI
	* The default label: this label is used to display the value in the web UI if the i18n translation isn't available
	* A checkbox to make the field mandatory during the registration process
	* A list of values you want to restrict for this field

_Note:_ Gravitee provides a list of predefined keys. There are visible by clicking on the key field. 

Once the user fields are defined, they will be displayed in the registration form of the console and the portal.

If you select a user, you have access to a detailed information about its account (including the custom fields) and permissions and the ability to manage its groups.

image::apim/3.x/adminguide/custom-user-fields-user-details.png[Gravitee.io - User With Custom Fields]

A user may visualize and update these information through the account page.

TIP: 	Translations of the label for the custom fields is based on the field key. To add translation for your own fields, please declare them in the translation files (https://github.com/gravitee-io/gravitee-portal-webui/blob/master/src/assets/i18n/en.json[en.json], https://github.com/gravitee-io/gravitee-portal-webui/blob/master/src/assets/i18n/fr.json[fr.json]...) under the element `register.field`. If no translation is available the default label will be used. 


== Groups

Groups represent users groups where you put members of the same team/partner and set their role for the `API` scope and/or `APPLICATION` scope (see link:/apim/3.x/apim_adminguide_roles_and_permissions.html[Roles and Permissions] for details).
Once a group is created, you can associate it to an API and/or an application and users with role on this scope become members of the API/Application.

Let use groups to create a `FOO Team` group where you can put all members of your FOO team.

=== Create the `FOO Team` group

image::apim/3.x/adminguide/usersgroups-newgroup.png[Gravitee.io - New Group]

You can see that in addition to the group name, you have two other section :

==== Roles & members
Max members::
Define the maximum number of members in this group (default is no limit).

Allows invitation via user search::

Allows email invitation::

Allows the group admin to change the API role::

Allows the group admin to change the Application role::

[]
==== Associations
Associate to every new API::
Every time an API is created, this group will be added to it.

Associate to every new Application::
Every time an Application is created, this group will be added to it.

_Those checkbox can be useful if the group is transverse (an helpdesk group for example)._

=== Configure users

After the group creation, you should be redirected to the group detail page.

image::apim/3.x/adminguide/usersgroups-editgroup.png[Gravitee.io - Edit Group]

Click on the (+) button to add users

image::apim/3.x/adminguide/usersgroups-addgroupmembers-1.png[Gravitee.io - Add Group members]

Select users and choose their roles (group default roles are automatically selected)

image::apim/3.x/adminguide/usersgroups-addgroupmembers-2.png[Gravitee.io - Group members]

=== Add the group to an API or an application

Go to the API/Application you want to modify and select the `groups` section.

image::apim/3.x/adminguide/usersgroups-apigroups.png[Gravitee.io - Api Group]

Now you can go to the `memberships` section to find that members of the `FOO Team` are members of the API with the role you have set globally.
