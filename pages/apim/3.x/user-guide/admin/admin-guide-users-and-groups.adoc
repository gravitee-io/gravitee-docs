== Overview

Users are listed in the APIM Console *Organization settings > Users* page.

You can:

 * Create a new user account
 * Remove a user account (only if the user is not a primary owner of an API or an application)

image::apim/3.x/adminguide/usersgroups-users.png[Gravitee.io - List users]

When you select a user, you can:

 * Access detailed information about the user's account and permissions
 * Manage the user's groups
 * Reset the user's password (only for users created with the registration form)
 * Manage the user's registration requests
 * Generate a token for the user

== Create a user

Administrators can register new users in APIM Console, and users can self-register with a registration form.

WARNING: Registration emails include a link to your system where users can complete their registration.
For the links to work, the *Management URL* and *Portal URL* settings shown in the images below must be correct.

image::apim/3.x/adminguide/usersgroups-management-url-parameter.png[]
image::apim/3.x/adminguide/usersgroups-portal-url-parameter.png[]

=== Create a user account in APIM Console

. In APIM Console, click *Organization settings > Users*.
. Click *Add user* at the top right of the page.
. Choose from the options available below.

==== Create a regular user

An email will be sent to the user asking them to complete the registration.

image::apim/3.14/admin-create-regular-user.png[Gravitee.io - Pre-Register User]

==== Create a service account

[label label-version]#New in version 3.14#

If you enter an email address, an email will be sent to the user asking them to complete the registration.

image::apim/3.14/admin-create-service-account.png[Gravitee.io - Pre-Register Service Account]

=== Create a user with the registration form

Users can self-register using the registration form, as described in link:{{ '/apim/3.x/apim_consumerguide_create_account.html' | relative_url }}[Create a user account] in the API Consumer Guide.

== Manage registration requests
By default, if the *Allow User Registration* option is enabled, then all registration requests generated by users filling in the registration form will be automatically validated. This option exists both in the Console and Portal settings.

image::apim/3.x/adminguide/usersgroups-console-auto-validation-parameters.png[Gravitee.io - Automatic registration validation option for console]
image::apim/3.x/adminguide/usersgroups-portal-auto-validation-parameters.png[Gravitee.io - Automatic registration validation option for portal]

=== Accept or reject a registration request

If the *Enable automatic validation of registration requests* option is disabled, then you can reject or accept user registration requests in APIM Console:

. In *Organization Settings*, click *Users*.
. Click a user with *PENDING* status.
+
image::apim/3.x/adminguide/usersgroups-manual-validation-1.png[Gravitee.io - Users status pour registration validation]
. Click *ACCEPT* or *REJECT*.
+
image::apim/3.x/adminguide/usersgroups-manual-validation-2.png[Gravitee.io - Manual registration validation]

NOTE: If a self-registered user has completed registration but the registration has not been accepted by an administrator, the user will not be able to sign in.

== Customize the self-registration form

If you want new users to self-register but need additional information during the registration process, you can add custom fields to the registration form.

To configure new custom fields:

. Click *Settings > User Fields*.
. Click the plus icon image:icons/plus-icon.png[role="icon"].
. Enter the following information:

	* Select the field key from the pre-defined list in the drop-down -- this is the field identifier, used to translate the label in APIM Portal.
	* The default label -- this label is used to display the value in APIM Portal if a translation is not available.
	* A checkbox to make the field mandatory during the registration process.
	* A list of values you want to restrict for this field.
+
image::apim/3.x/adminguide/custom-user-fields-create.png[Gravitee.io - Create User Field]

. Click *CREATE USER FIELD*.

Once the user fields are defined, they will be displayed in the APIM Console and Portal registration forms.

image::apim/3.x/adminguide/custom-user-fields-registration.png[Gravitee.io - Registration With User Field]

== View and update a user

You can view detailed information about a user account, including any information added through custom fields, permissions and group management capabilities by selecting the user in the *Organization settings > Users* list.

image::apim/3.x/adminguide/custom-user-fields-user-details.png[Gravitee.io - User With Custom Fields]

Users can view and update this information on their account page.

image::apim/3.x/adminguide/custom-user-fields-account.png[Gravitee.io - User Account]

TIP: Translations of the label for custom fields are based on the field key. To add translations for your own fields, you need to declare them in the translation files (https://github.com/gravitee-io/gravitee-api-management/blob/master/gravitee-apim-portal-webui/src/assets/i18n/en.json[en.json], https://github.com/gravitee-io/gravitee-api-management/blob/master/gravitee-apim-portal-webui/src/assets/i18n/fr.json[fr.json]...) under the element `register.field`. If no translation is available, the default label will be used.

[[token_management]]
== Manage user tokens

[label label-version]#New in version 3.14#

You can create one or more tokens for your users. You can see if a user has active tokens in the list display:

image::apim/3.14/admin-user-tokens.png[]

To create a new user token:

. Click *Organization settings > users*.
. Select the user.
. Click *Generate a personal token*.
+
image::apim/3.14/admin-token-management.png[]

. Enter the details of the token:
+
image::apim/3.14/admin-token-management-form.png[]
+
APIM displays the token.
+
WARNING: The token is only displayed once. Keep it somewhere safe.
+
image::apim/3.14/admin-token-management-example.png[]

== Create a group

You can create user groups to which you can add members of the same team/partner and set their role for the `API` scope and/or `APPLICATION` scope (see link:{{ '/apim/3.x/apim_adminguide_roles_and_permissions.html' | relative_url }}[Roles and permissions^] for details).
Once a group is created, you can associate it with an API and/or an application. Users with roles for this scope become members of the API/application.

In this example, we will create a `FOO Team` group to which you can add all members of your FOO team.

=== Create the `FOO Team` group

image::apim/3.x/adminguide/usersgroups-newgroup.png[Gravitee.io - New Group]

You can see that in addition to the group name, you have two other sections:

*Roles & Members*

* Max members -- defines the maximum number of members in this group (default is no limit).
* Allows invitation via user search
* Allows email invitation
* Allows the group admin to change the API role
* Allows the group admin to change the application role

*Associations*

* Associate to every new API -- every time an API is created, this group will be added to it.
* Associate to every new application -- every time an application is created, this group will be added to it.

NOTE: These checkboxes are particularly useful for groups which traverse different teams (a helpdesk group, for example).

=== Configure users

. On the group detail page, click the plus icon image:icons/plus-icon.png[role="icon"], then click *Add member* to add users.
+
image::apim/3.x/adminguide/usersgroups-addgroupmembers-1.png[Gravitee.io - Add Group members]

. Select users and choose their roles (group default roles are automatically selected).
+
image::apim/3.x/adminguide/usersgroups-addgroupmembers-2.png[Gravitee.io - Group members]

=== Add the group to an API or application

. Go to the API/application you want to modify and click *Groups*. In this example we will add to the group to an API.
. Click the down arrow and select the group you want to add.
+
image::apim/3.x/adminguide/usersgroups-apigroups.png[Gravitee.io - Api Group]
+
If you return to *Settings > Groups* and select the group name, you can now see the API listed in the *Dependents* section.
+
image::apim/3.x/adminguide/usersgroups-groups-dependents.png[Gravitee.io - Api Group]
+
This means members of the `FOO Team` are members of the API with the role you set in <<Configure users>>.

[[primary_owner_mode]]
== Configure primary owner groups

[label label-version]#New in version 3.7#

From APIM 3.7, you can configure three different ways of managing primary owners for APIs in APIM Console:

image::apim/3.x/api-publisher-guide/manage-apis/graviteeio-api-primaryowner-mode-1.png[]

USER::

* Only users can be primary owner of an API
* Creating primary owner groups is not allowed

GROUP::

* Only primary owner groups can be primary owner of an API
* Creating primary owner groups is allowed
* To create or import an API, you must belong to at least one primary owner group
* You can only transfer API ownership to a primary owner group which you belong to

HYBRID (default)::

* Creating primary owner groups is allowed
* Either a primary owner group or a user can be primary owner of an API
* You can transfer API ownership to either a primary owner group or a user

[NOTE]
====

For a group to be defined as primary owner, it must contain one member with the PRIMARY OWNER role in the link:{{ '/apim/3.x/apim_adminguide_roles_and_permissions.html#scopes' | relative_url }}[API scope^].
You can only add one member with the PRIMARY OWNER role to a group.

====

=== Update the API primary owner mode

. link:{{ '/apim/3.x/apim_quickstart_console_login.html' | relative_url }}[Log in to APIM Console^].
. Click *Settings > Settings*.
. Set *API Primary Owner mode* to *HYBRID* or *GROUP*.
+
Any groups which include a PRIMARY OWNER member will now be available to add to your APIs.
For more details, see link:{{ '/apim/3.x/apim_publisherguide_create_apis.html' | relative_url }}[Create APIs^].
