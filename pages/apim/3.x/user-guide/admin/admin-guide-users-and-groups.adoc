== Overview

Users are listed in the APIM Console *Organization settings > Users* page.

You can:

 * Create a new user account
 * Remove a user account (only if the user is not a primary owner of an API or an application)

image::apim/3.x/adminguide/usersgroups-users.png[Gravitee.io - List users]

When you select a user, you can:

 * access detailed information about the user's account and permissions
 * manage the user's groups
 * reset the user's password (only for users created with the registration form)
 * manage the user's registration requests

image::apim/3.x/adminguide/usersgroups-user.png[Gravitee.io - User]

See also: link:/apim/3.x/apim_installguide_authentication.html[Configure authentication^].

== Create a user
=== As an administrator
Administrators can pre-register a user by clicking the plus icon image:icons/plus-icon.png[role="icon"] at the bottom right of the page.
An email will be sent to the user requesting them to finalize the registration.

image::apim/3.x/adminguide/usersgroups-pre-register-user.png[Gravitee.io - Pre-Register User, 300]

[WARNING]
====
You need to check your APIM Portal and Management URLs in the settings to ensure the links in registration emails are correct.

====

=== With the registration form
Ordinary users can self-register using the registration form, as described in link:/apim/3.x/apim_consumerguide_create_account.html[Create a user account] in the API Consumer Guide.

== Manage registration requests
By default, if the `Allow User Registration` option is enabled, then all registration requests generated by users filling in the registration form will be automatically validated.

image::apim/3.x/adminguide/usersgroups-console-auto-validation-parameters.png[Gravitee.io - Automatic registration validation option for console]
image::apim/3.x/adminguide/usersgroups-portal-auto-validation-parameters.png[Gravitee.io - Automatic registration validation option for portal]

If you disable this option, then you will be able to reject or accept user registration requests in the *Users* page.

image::apim/3.x/adminguide/usersgroups-manual-validation-2.png[Gravitee.io - Manual registration validation]

NOTE: If a self-registered user has finalized their registration but the registration has not been accepted by an administrator, the user will not be able to sign in.

== User fields

If you want new users to self-register but need additional information during the registration process, you can add custom fields to the registration form.

To configure new custom fields:

. Click *Settings > User Fields*.
. Click the plus icon image:icons/plus-icon.png[role="icon"].
+
image::apim/3.x/adminguide/custom-user-fields-list.png[Gravitee.io - User Fields]

. Enter the following information:

	* Select the field key from the pre-defined list in the drop-down -- this is the field identifier, used to translate the label in APIM Portal
	* The default label -- this label is used to display the value in APIM Portal if a translation is not available
	* A checkbox to make the field mandatory during the registration process
	* A list of values you want to restrict for this field
+
image::apim/3.x/adminguide/custom-user-fields-create.png[Gravitee.io - Create User Field]

. Click *CREATE USER FIELD*.

Once the user fields are defined, they will be displayed in the APIM Console and Portal registration forms.

image::apim/3.x/adminguide/custom-user-fields-registration.png[Gravitee.io - Registration With User Field]

== View and update a user

You can view detailed information about a user account, including any information added through custom fields, permissions and group management capabilities by selecting the user in the *Organization settings > Users* list.

image::apim/3.x/adminguide/custom-user-fields-user-details.png[Gravitee.io - User With Custom Fields]

Users can view and update this information on their account page.

image::apim/3.x/adminguide/custom-user-fields-account.png[Gravitee.io - User Account]

TIP: Translations of the label for custom fields are based on the field key. To add translations for your own fields, you need to declare them in the translation files (https://github.com/gravitee-io/gravitee-api-management/blob/master/gravitee-apim-portal-webui/src/assets/i18n/en.json[en.json], https://github.com/gravitee-io/gravitee-api-management/blob/master/gravitee-apim-portal-webui/src/assets/i18n/fr.json[fr.json]...) under the element `register.field`. If no translation is available, the default label will be used.

== Groups

Groups represent user groups to which you add members of the same team/partner and set their role for the `API` scope and/or `APPLICATION` scope (see link:/apim/3.x/apim_adminguide_roles_and_permissions.html[Roles and permissions^] for details).
Once a group is created, you can associate it with an API and/or an application. Users with roles for this scope become members of the API/application.

In this example will create a `FOO Team` group to which you can add all members of your FOO team.

=== Create the `FOO Team` group

image::apim/3.x/adminguide/usersgroups-newgroup.png[Gravitee.io - New Group]

You can see that in addition to the group name, you have two other sections:

*Roles & Members*

* Max members -- defines the maximum number of members in this group (default is no limit).
* Allows invitation via user search
* Allows email invitation
* Allows the group admin to change the API role
* Allows the group admin to change the application role

*Associations*

* Associate to every new API -- every time an API is created, this group will be added to it.
* Associate to every new application -- every time an application is created, this group will be added to it.

NOTE: These checkboxes are particularly useful for groups which traverse different teams (a helpdesk group, for example).

=== Configure users

. On the group detail page, click the plus icon image:icons/plus-icon.png[role="icon"], then click *Add member* to add users.
+
image::apim/3.x/adminguide/usersgroups-addgroupmembers-1.png[Gravitee.io - Add Group members]

. Select users and choose their roles (group default roles are automatically selected).
+
image::apim/3.x/adminguide/usersgroups-addgroupmembers-2.png[Gravitee.io - Group members]

=== Add the group to an API or application

. Go to the API/application you want to modify and click *Groups*. In this example we will add to the group to an API.
. Click the down arrow and select the group you want to add.
+
image::apim/3.x/adminguide/usersgroups-apigroups.png[Gravitee.io - Api Group]
+
If you return to *Settings > Groups* and select the group name, you can now see the API listed in the *Dependents* section.
+
image::apim/3.x/adminguide/usersgroups-groups-dependents.png[Gravitee.io - Api Group]
+
This means members of the `FOO Team` are members of the API with the role you set in <<Configure users>>.

[[primary_owner_mode]]
== Configure primary owner groups

[label label-version]#New in version 3.7#

From APIM 3.7, you can configure three different ways of managing primary owners for APIs in APIM Console:

image::apim/3.x/api-publisher-guide/manage-apis/graviteeio-api-primaryowner-mode-1.png[]

USER::

* Only users can be primary owner of an API
* Creating primary owner groups is not allowed

GROUP::

* Only primary owner groups can be primary owner of an API
* Creating primary owner groups is allowed
* To create or import an API, you must belong to at least one primary owner group
* You can only transfer API ownership to a primary owner group which you belong to

HYBRID (default)::

* Creating primary owner groups is allowed
* Either a primary owner group or a user can be primary owner of an API
* You can transfer API ownership to either a primary owner group or a user

[NOTE]
====

For a group to be defined as primary owner, it must contain one member with the PRIMARY OWNER role in the    link:/apim/3.x/apim_adminguide_roles_and_permissions.html#scopes[API scope^].
You can only add one member with the PRIMARY OWNER role to a group.

====

=== Update the API primary owner mode

. link:/apim/3.x/apim_quickstart_console_login.html[Log in to APIM Console^].
. Click *Settings > Settings*.
. Set *API Primary Owner mode* to *HYBRID* or *GROUP*.
+
Any groups which include a PRIMARY OWNER member will now be available to add to your APIs.
For more details, see link:/apim/3.x/apim_publisherguide_create_apis.html[Create APIs^].
