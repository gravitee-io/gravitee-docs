== Users

In the installation guide, you have learnt how to configure different identity providers (see link:/apim/3.x/apim_installguide_authentication.html[how to configure authentication]).

Users are listed in the `Users` section of the `Settings` menu.

Here you can :

 * remove a user account (only if the user is not a primary owner of an api or an application),
 * reset its password (only for users created with the Gravitee form)

If you select a user, you have access to a detailed information about its account and permissions and the ability to manage its groups.

== Groups

Groups represent users groups where you put members of the same team/partner and set their role for the `API` scope and/or `APPLICATION` scope (see link:/apim/3.x/apim_adminguide_roles_and_permissions.html[Roles and Permissions] for details).
Once a group is created, you can associate it to an API and/or an application and users with role on this scope become members of the API/Application.

Let use groups to create a `FOO Team` group where you can put all members of your FOO team.

=== Create the `FOO Team` group

You can see that in addition to the group name, you have two other section :

==== Roles & members
Max members::
Define the maximum number of members in this group (default is no limit).

Allows invitation via user search::

Allows email invitation::

Allows the group admin to change the API role::

Allows the group admin to change the Application role::

[]
==== Associations
Associate to every new API::
Every time an API is created, this group will be added to it.

Associate to every new Application::
Every time an Application is created, this group will be added to it.

_Those checkbox can be useful if the group is transverse (an helpdesk group for example)._

=== Configure users

After the group creation, you should be redirected to the group detail page.

Click on the (+) button to add users

Select users and choose their roles (group default roles are automatically selected)

=== Add the group to an API or an application

Go to the API/Application you want to modify and select the `groups` section.

Now you can go to the `memberships` section to find that members of the `FOO Team` are members of the API with the role you have set globally.
