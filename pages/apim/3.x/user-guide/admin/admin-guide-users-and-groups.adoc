== Users

The Installation Guide explained how to configure different identity providers (see link:/apim/3.x/apim_installguide_authentication.html[Configure authentication]).

Users are listed in the *Users* section of the *Settings* menu.

You can:

 * Create a new user account
 * Remove a user account (only if the user is not a primary owner of an API or an application)

image::apim/3.x/adminguide/usersgroups-users.png[Gravitee.io - List users]

When you select a user, you can:

 * access detailed information about the user's account and permissions
 * manage the user's groups
 * reset the user's password (only for users created with the registration form)
 * manage the user's registration requests

image::apim/3.x/adminguide/usersgroups-user.png[Gravitee.io - User]

=== Create a user

==== As an administrator
You can pre-register a user by clicking the *Add* button at the bottom right of the page.
An email will be sent to the user requesting them to finalize the registration.

image::apim/3.x/adminguide/usersgroups-pre-register-user.png[Gravitee.io - Pre-Register User, 300]

[WARNING]
====
You need to check your APIM Portal and Management URLs in the settings to ensure the links in registration emails are correct.

====

==== With the registration form
Ordinary users can register using the `Registration form`. +
For more information, see more link:/apim/3.x/apim_consumerguide_create_account.html[Create a user account].

=== Manage registration requests
By default, if the `Allow User Registration` option is enabled then all registration requests will be automatically validated.

image::apim/3.x/adminguide/usersgroups-auto-validation-parameters.png[Gravitee.io - Automatic registration validation option]

If you disable this option, then you will be able to reject or accept user registration requests in the Users page.

image::apim/3.x/adminguide/usersgroups-manual-validation-2.png[Gravitee.io - Manual registration validation]

NOTE: If a self-registered user has finalized their registration but the registration has not been accepted by an administrator, the user will not be able to sign in.

== User fields

If you allow new users to register, you can request additional fields during the registration process.

To configure the list of custom fields, go to the *User Fields* menu and click the (+) button.

image::apim/3.x/adminguide/custom-user-fields-list.png[Gravitee.io - User Fields]

You will be prompted for the following information:

	* The field key: this is the field identifier, used to translate the label in APIM Portal
	* The default label: this label is used to display the value in APIM Portal if a translation is not available
	* A checkbox to make the field mandatory during the registration process
	* A list of values you want to restrict for this field

image::apim/3.x/adminguide/custom-user-fields-create.png[Gravitee.io - Create User Field]

NOTE: APIM provides a list of predefined keys. There are visible by clicking on the key field.

Once the user fields are defined, they will be displayed in the registration form of the console and the portal.

image::apim/3.x/adminguide/custom-user-fields-registration.png[Gravitee.io - Registration With User Field]

If you select a user, you have access to a detailed information about its account (including the custom fields) and permissions and the ability to manage its groups.

image::apim/3.x/adminguide/custom-user-fields-user-details.png[Gravitee.io - User With Custom Fields]

Users can view and update this information on their account page.

image::apim/3.x/adminguide/custom-user-fields-account.png[Gravitee.io - User Account]

TIP: Translations of the label for custom fields are based on the field key. To add translations for your own fields, you need to declare them in the translation files (https://github.com/gravitee-io/gravitee-portal-webui/blob/master/src/assets/i18n/en.json[en.json], https://github.com/gravitee-io/gravitee-portal-webui/blob/master/src/assets/i18n/fr.json[fr.json]...) under the element `register.field`. If no translation is available, the default label will be used.


== Groups

Groups represent user groups to which you add members of the same team/partner and set their role for the `API` scope and/or `APPLICATION` scope (see link:/apim/3.x/apim_adminguide_roles_and_permissions.html[Roles and permissions] for details).
Once a group is created, you can associate it with an API and/or an application. Users with roles for this scope become members of the API/application.

In this example will create a `FOO Team` group to which you can add all members of your FOO team.

=== Create the `FOO Team` group

image::apim/3.x/adminguide/usersgroups-newgroup.png[Gravitee.io - New Group]

You can see that in addition to the group name, you have two other sections:

==== Roles & members
Max members::
Define the maximum number of members in this group (default is no limit).

Allows invitation via user search::

Allows email invitation::

Allows the group admin to change the API role::

Allows the group admin to change the application role::

[]
==== Associations
Associate to every new API::
Every time an API is created, this group will be added to it.

Associate to every new application::
Every time an application is created, this group will be added to it.

_These checkboxes can be useful if the group crosses teams (a helpdesk group for example)._

=== Configure users

After group creation, you are redirected to the group detail page.

image::apim/3.x/adminguide/usersgroups-editgroup.png[Gravitee.io - Edit Group]

Click the *+* button to add users:

image::apim/3.x/adminguide/usersgroups-addgroupmembers-1.png[Gravitee.io - Add Group members]

Select users and choose their roles (group default roles are automatically selected):

image::apim/3.x/adminguide/usersgroups-addgroupmembers-2.png[Gravitee.io - Group members]

=== Add the group to an API or application

Go to the API/application you want to modify and select the *Groups* section:

image::apim/3.x/adminguide/usersgroups-apigroups.png[Gravitee.io - Api Group]

In the *Memberships* section, you will see that members of the `FOO Team` are members of the API with the role you set globally.
