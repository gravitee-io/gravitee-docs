== Overview

Platform flows are executed before and after any API flows of the organization. They can be defined in the organization settings and are automatically deployed on every change.

== Execution flow
Platform flows are encapsulating API flows as follows:

- Platform flow request policies are executed *before* API flow request policies
- Platform flow response policies are executed *after* API flow response policies

== Typical use cases
You can use platform flows to enforce policies at the organization level such as:

- reporting - e.g. Metrics Reporter
- security - e.g. IPFiltering


== Known limitations
Platform flows do currently not support conditional policies.
