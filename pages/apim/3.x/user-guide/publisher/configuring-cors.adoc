CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a mechanism that allows resources on a web page to be requested from another domain.

For more information on CORS, first take a look at the https://www.w3.org/TR/cors[CORS specification].

== Configuration
You can configure CORS for an API in *Proxy > CORS* in the *APIs* menu of APIM Management. The sections below detail the values you can specify.

=== Access-Control-Allow-Origin

One or multiple origins that can access the resource.
If you want to allow all origins, you can enter `*`. Note that this is not safe for production environments.

=== Access-Control-Allow-Methods

The method or methods allowed to access the resource. This is used in response to a preflight request.

=== Access-Control-Allow-Headers

The headers allowed in your requests.
Typically, your request header will include `Access-Control-Request-Headers`, which relies on CORS configuration to allow its values.

A simple use case is as follows:

A user makes a call with a header `Access-Control-Request-Headers: my-header`.

- If CORS `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` is not configured with the header `my-header`, the request will receive a 400 HTTP status response.
- If CORS `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` includes the header `my-header`, the request will receive a 200 HTTP status response.

NOTE: Wildcard (`*`) is not allowed.

=== Access-Control-Allow-Credentials

Indicates whether or not the response to the request can be exposed when the credentials flag is `true`.

=== Access-Control-Allow-Max-Age

indicates how long the results of a preflight request can be cached (`-1` if disabled).

=== Access-Control-Expose-Headers

Provides a server whitelist headers that browsers are allowed to access.

== Troubleshooting CORS

All requests rejected because of CORS issues will generate some logs that you can view in the `Analytics` section of your API logs.
