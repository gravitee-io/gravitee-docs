== Overview

Once an API is registered and made public, you can manage subscriptions to it through APIM _plans_. Managing subscriptions and plans is a key feature of APIM that publishers can use to provide and regulate access to APIs.

== What is a plan?

A plan provides a service and access layer on top of your API for consumer link:/apim/3.x/apim_overview_concepts.html#gravitee-concepts-application[applications].
A plan specifies access limits, subscription validation modes and other configuration to tailor it to a specific application.

In the context of modern API strategy, the concept of _API as a Product_ is at the core of the APIM approach.
This means that we do not merely provide technical API resources, but adopt a business and service perspective for consumers to leverage your product line.

Imagine the following scenarios:

* An OpenAPI plan with read-only access and limited request traffic for potential customers to discover and try your API
* A premium plan with public resources and access limits for your partners
* An internal plan with complete access to your internal enterprise applications

These scenarios can be difficult to encode into your APIs and are better managed using external tools. APIM manages all of these scenarios and more using plans.

To subscribe to a plan, developers must create an link:/apim/3.x/apim_overview_concepts.html#gravitee-concepts-application[application^] and associate it with a plan.
This creates a subscription, which is verified in order to accept or deny the incoming request.

== How to create a plan

You can create plans in APIM Console as part of the API creation process.

To create or manage a plan with access to all plan features, however, use the *Portal > Plans* function. The workflow is as follows:

. *Define* -- create the basic plan definition (see <<Create a plan>>)
. *Secure* -- specify details of the plan security (see <<Configure plan security>>)
. *Restrictions* -- specify details of plan restrictions (see <<Configure plan restrictions>>)
. *Policies* -- add policy definitions (see <<Configure plan policies>>)

== Create a plan

== Configure plan security

You configure the level of security required for accessing your API as part of creating a plan.
APIM supports the following four security types:

* Keyless (public)
* API Key
* OAuth 2.0
* JWT

=== Keyless plans

Keyless plans allow public access to the API and bypass any security mechanisms on the whole request process.

Keyless plans offer no security and are most useful for quickly and easily exposing your API to external users and getting their feedback.
Due to the lack of consumer identifier token (API key), keyless consumers are set as `unknown application` in the API analytics section.

=== API Key plans

You use API Key plans to enforce verification of API keys during request processing, allowing only apps with approved API keys to access your APIs.
This plan type ensures that API keys are valid, are not revoked or expired and are approved to consume the specific resources associated with your API.

API key plans offer only a basic level of security, acting more as a unique identifier than a security token, since the API key can easily be found in the app code.
For a higher level of security, see OAuth 2.0 and JWT plans.

==== Use a custom API key

You can specify a custom API key for an API key plan. This is particularly useful when you want to silently migrate to APIM and have a pre-defined API key.

NOTE: The custom API key feature can be enabled in the global settings of APIM.

The custom API key must have more than 8 characters, less than 64 characters and be URL compliant (^ # % @ \ / ; = ? | ~ , (space) are invalid characters)

When prompted, you can choose to provide your custom API key or let APIM generate one for you by leaving the field empty.

You can provide a custom API key when:

* creating a subscription:

image::apim/3.x/api-publisher-guide/plans-subscriptions/custom-api-key-1.png[Gravitee.io - Create subscription with custom API key, 873, 530, align=center, title-align=center]

* accepting a subscription:

image::apim/3.x/api-publisher-guide/plans-subscriptions/custom-api-key-2.png[Gravitee.io - Accept subscription with custom API key, 873, 530, align=center, title-align=center]

* renewing a subscription:

image::apim/3.x/api-publisher-guide/plans-subscriptions/custom-api-key-3.png[Gravitee.io - Renew custom API key, 873, 530, align=center, title-align=center]

=== OAuth 2.0 plans

You can specify a custom API key for an API key plan. This is particularly useful when you want to silently migrate to APIM and have a pre-defined API key.

NOTE: The custom API key feature can be enabled in the global settings of APIM.

The custom API key must have more than 8 characters, less than 64 characters and be URL compliant (^ # % @ \ / ; = ? | ~ , (space) are invalid characters)

When prompted, you can choose to provide your custom API key or let APIM generate one for you by leaving the field empty.

You can provide a custom API key when:

* creating a subscription:

==== Create and specify an OAuth 2.0 authorization server

Before you create an OAuth 2.0 plan, you first need to create an OAuth 2.0 client resource that represents your OAuth 2.0 authorization server, then specify its details as follows:

. Go to your API in APIM Console and click *Design > Resources*.
. Create a new *Generic OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Resource*.
+
NOTE: If you use https://gravitee.io/[Gravitee.io Access Management], we provide a dedicated OAuth 2.0 AM resource.
+
image::apim/3.x/api-publisher-guide/plans-subscriptions/create-oauth2-resource.png[Gravitee.io - Create OAuth 2.0 resource, 873, 530, align=center, title-align=center]

. Set the *OAuth 2.0 Authorization server URL*.
. Set the https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7662[Token introspection endpoint] URI with the correct HTTP method and https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-3.3[scope] delimiter.
. If you want to retrieve consented claims about the end user, enter the http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#UserInfo[UserInfo Endpoint] URI.
. Enter the *client id* and *client secret* used for token introspection.
+
NOTE: Why do I need this? As defined in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7662#section-2.1[RFC 7662], to prevent token scanning attacks,
the introspection endpoint *must* also require some form of authorization to access this endpoint, such as client authentication.

==== Create an OAuth 2.0 plan

. In APIM Console, click *Portal > Plans*.
. Create your new plan.
. When you reach the *Secure* section (the second step), choose *OAuth2* as the authorization type.
. Specify the OAuth2 resource name you created and check any https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-3.3[scopes] to access the API.
+
image::apim/3.x/api-publisher-guide/plans-subscriptions/create-oauth2-plan.png[Gravitee.io - Create OAuth 2.0 plan, 873, 530, align=center, title-align=center]
+
. Click *NEXT*, then *SAVE* to save your new plan.
+
NOTE: After you create the plan, you need to publish it to make it available to consumers.
+
Your API is now OAuth 2.0 secured and consumers must call the API with an `Authorization Bearer :token:` HTTP header to access the API resources.

IMPORTANT: Any applications wanting to subscribe to an OAuth 2.0 plan must have an existing client with a valid `client_id` registered in the OAuth 2.0 authorization server.
The `client_id` will be used to establish a connection between the OAuth 2.0 client and the APIM consumer application.

=== JSON Web Tokens (JWT) plans

JWT plans ensure that JWT tokens issued by third parties are valid. Only apps with approved JWT tokens can access APIs associated with a JWT plan.

https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519[JSON Web Tokens] are an open method for representing claims securely between two parties.
JWT are digitally-signed using HMAC shared keys or RSA public/private key pairs. JWT plans allow you to verify the signature of the JWT and check if the JWT is still valid according to its expiry date.

NOTE: JWT define some https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1[registered claim names] including subject, issuer, audience, expiration time and not-before time. In addition to these claims, the inbound JWT payload
must include the `client_id` claim (see below) to establish a connection between the JWT and the APIM application subscription.

The policy searches for a client ID in the payload as follows:

* First in the `azp` claim
* Next in the `aud` claim
* Finally in the `client_id` claim

==== Create a JWT plan

. In APIM Console, click *Portal > Plans*.
. Create your new plan.
. When you reach the *Secure* section (the second step), choose *JWT* as the authorization type.
. Specify the public key used to verify the incoming JWT token.
+
NOTE: You can also set the public key can also be set in the `gravitee.yml` file. See link:/apim/3.x/apim_policies_jwt.html[JWT policy] for more information. APIM only supports the RSA Public Key format.
+
image::apim/3.x/api-publisher-guide/plans-subscriptions/create-jwt-plan.png[Gravitee.io - Create JWT plan, 873, 530, align=center, title-align=center]
. Click *NEXT*, then *SAVE* to save your new plan.
+
NOTE: After you create the plan, you need to publish it to make it available to consumers.
+
Your API is now JWT secured and consumers must call the API with an `Authorization Bearer :JWT Token:` HTTP header to access the API resources.

== Configure plan restrictions

Plans exist to provide and secure access to the API through their authorization type, but they also include some more advanced features to restrict the plan.

image::apim/3.x/api-publisher-guide/plans-subscriptions/add-plan-restrictions.png[]

=== Limit request traffic

Plans provide tools for maintaining and optimizing traffic management and protecting the health of the API backend.

==== Rate-limiting

You can rate limit how many HTTP requests an application can make in a specified period of seconds or minutes.

In the following example, the plan enforces a limit of 1000 requests per minute:

image::apim/3.x/api-publisher-guide/plans-subscriptions/create-plan-rate-limit.png[Gravitee.io - Create plan - Rate-Limit , 873, 530, align=center, title-align=center]

NOTE: Rate-limiting helps you prevent sudden increases in the number of requests at any point in time.

==== Quotas

A quota specifies the number of requests allowed to call an API backend during a specified time interval.

In the following example, the plan enforces a limit of 100000 requests per day:

image::apim/3.x/api-publisher-guide/plans-subscriptions/create-plan-quota.png[Gravitee.io - Create plan - Rate-Limit , 873, 530, align=center, title-align=center]

NOTE: You can use quotas to enforce business or financial requirements to limit the number of calls partner or third-party apps can make in a period of time.

=== Path authorization

You can use path authorization to limit access to a subset of API resources.

In the following example, the plan only allows GET requests:

image::apim/3.x/api-publisher-guide/plans-subscriptions/create-plan-path-authorization.png[Gravitee.io - Create plan - Path Authorization , 873, 530, align=center, title-align=center]

NOTE: You can use path authorization to make an API read-only for public members and give premium members access to more resources.

== Configure plan policies

You can configure a policy or chain of policies of one or more types.

. Choose a policy type from the list and click *ADD*.
+
image::apim/3.x/api-publisher-guide/plans-subscriptions/add-plan-policies.png[]
+
. Depending on the policy type, specify any other required details of the policy.
. If you want to create a policy chain, repeat the same steps for each policy in the chain.

== Plan general conditions of use

You can provide general conditions of use for a plan. These conditions must be accepted by the user to finalize the subscription process.

To associate general conditions of use with a plan, you need to specify a markdown page where these conditions are specified. Note that the page needs to be created first.

image::apim/3.x/api-publisher-guide/plans-subscriptions/add-general-conditions.png[Gravitee.io - add  general conditions, 873, 530, align=center, title-align=center]

Plans with general conditions are identified by a `With general conditions` label.

image::apim/3.x/api-publisher-guide/plans-subscriptions/general-conditions-plans.png[Gravitee.io - Plan with general conditions, 873, 530, align=center, title-align=center]

NOTE: Users can only subscribe to plans with general conditions through APIM Portal.

== Manage subscriptions

Consumers use plans to request subscriptions and access your APIs. They subscribe to plans in APIM Portal:

image::apim/3.x/api-publisher-guide/plans-subscriptions/plans-subscriptions.png[Gravitee.io - API plans , 873, 530, align=center, title-align=center]

The following sections describe how to manage subscription requests from consumers.

=== Approve a subscription

When publishers create new plans, they can specify auto validation of subscriptions, so consumers are ready to access the API as soon as they subscribe to the plan.
If you set manual approval on a plan, however, you must approve subscriptions by following these steps:

NOTE: If you enable mail or portal notification, you can be notified when a task requires your attention to validate the subscription.

. Go to your API in APIM Management and click *Portal > Subscriptions*.
. Select the *Pending* subscription.
. Click *ACCEPT*, then enter the start and end dates (no end date means forever) of subscription approval.
+
image::apim/3.x/api-publisher-guide/plans-subscriptions/approve-subscription.png[Gravitee.io - approve subscription , 873, 530, align=center, title-align=center]

=== Revoke a subscription

You can revoke a subscription to remove access to APIs.

. Go to your API in APIM Management and click *Portal > Subscriptions*.
. Select the subscription you want to revoke and click *CLOSE*.
+
