== Overview

The following sections describe the different ways you can create an API using APIM Console.

For a quick introduction to creating an API in APIM, see the link:/apim/3.x/apim_quickstart_publish_ui.html[Quick Start Guide^].

NOTE: From APIM 3.5.x, the recommended way to create an API is using the *DESIGN STUDIO* method described in the next section. For APIs created using this method, clicking the *Design* menu option automatically opens Design Studio.
Old API definitions or APIs created using the *PATH BASED* option must be migrated before you can update them in Design Studio. For more information, see the link:/apim/3.x/apim_publisherguide_design_studio_overview.html[Design Studio Guide^].

== Get started

Using APIM Console, you can create new API definitions from scratch, or import existing definitions.

NOTE: You can also create APIs using APIM API. For more details, see the link:/apim/3.x/apim_quickstart_publish_api.html[Quick Start Guide^].

To start creating an API:

. In APIM Console, click *APIs*.
. Click the plus icon image:icons/plus-icon.png[role="icon"] at the bottom right of the page.
+
image::apim/3.10/apim-console-create-api.png[Create API]
+
APIM presents you with two options for creating APIs. The recommended option is **DESIGN STUDIO**.
+
image::apim/3.x/quickstart/publish/graviteeio-create-api-2.png[]

. Under *DESIGN STUDIO*, click:

  * *CREATE* to create an API from scratch.
+
Learn how to <<create_an_api_from_scratch>>

 * *IMPORT* to import an external API definition.
+
Learn how to <<import_an_api_definition>>

== Create an API from scratch

These steps describe how to create all of the basic API configuration your developers need to call your API.
If a short TTFAC (time to first API call) is your goal, configure only the mandatory parts and a basic plan now -- you can always update these later on.

NOTE: You need to create a plan before you can accept user subscriptions to your API. You can do that now or when you get to the link:/apim/3.x/apim_publisherguide_plans_subscriptions.html[Plans and subscriptions^] section, but the plan options available to you now are more limited.

. Enter the general details of the API:
  * A **Name**, **Version**, and **Description**.
  * The **Context-path** where the API will be exposed on APIM Gateway, starting from **/**.
+
image::apim/3.x/api-publisher-guide/manage-apis/create-api-general-withgroups.png[]

. (Optional) Associate a group with the API, if any are defined (see link:/apim/3.x/apim_adminguide_users_and_groups.html[Users and Groups] for more details):
      * Select a group which can access the API in **Groups**.
      * If the link:/apim/3.x/apim_adminguide_users_and_groups.html#primary_owner_mode[Primary owner mode^] is *HYBRID*, click the *Advanced mode* link to associate a primary owner group.
+
image::apim/3.x/api-publisher-guide/manage-apis/graviteeio-api-primaryowner-mode-3.png[]

. Click *NEXT*.
. Enter the details of the gateway:
  * A backend URL for receiving API calls.
  * (Optional) Click the **Advanced mode** link to specify details of tenants and sharding tags.
+
image::apim/3.x/api-publisher-guide/manage-apis/create-api-gateway.png[]

. Click *NEXT*.
. (Optional) If you want to create a plan for the API, enter the following details and click **NEXT**, otherwise click *SKIP*:
  * The *Name*, *Security type*, and *Description*.
  * If subscription auto-validation is required, toggle on the *Auto validate subscription* option.
  * The *Characteristics*.
  * *Rate limit* and *Quota* details. In this example, we are specifying a rate limit of 1 request every 5 seconds.
+
image::apim/3.x/api-publisher-guide/manage-apis/create-api-plan1.png[]
  * *Resource filtering* details, using link:/apim/3.x/apim_policies_overview.html#ant-notation[Ant^] notation and an HTTP method.
+
image::apim/3.x/api-publisher-guide/manage-apis/create-api-plan-path.png[]

. (Optional) Import a documentation specification file, otherwise click *SKIP*.
. Review the details of the API, then click one of the following options, depending on whether you want to create and deploy the API or simply create it:
  * *CREATE THE API WITHOUT DEPLOYING IT*
  * *CREATE AND START THE API*
+

== Import an API definition

You can import external API definitions using one of the following methods.

=== Import an existing API definition
You can import and export your APIs to a Gravitee API definition format (see the example below).

To import an API from an API definition:

* If the definition is a file, select *IMPORT FILE* and browse your file system to select it.

image::apim/3.x/api-publisher-guide/manage-apis/graviteeio-import-definition-file.png[Import from definition file, 300]

* If the definition is a link, select *IMPORT FROM LINK*, then choose *API Definition* and enter the definition URL.

image::apim/3.x/api-publisher-guide/manage-apis/graviteeio-import-definition-link.png[Import from definition link, 300]

Example Gravitee API definition::
[source,json]
----
{
  "name": "My first API",
  "version": "1",
  "description": "Gravitee.io Echo API Proxy",
  "visibility": "private",
  "paths": {
    "/": []
  },
  "resources": [],
  "members": [
    {
      "source": "memory",
      "sourceId": "admin",
      "roles": [
        "2eb2dc44-5cc9-48fa-b2dc-445cc978fa66"
      ]
    }
  ],
  ...
}
----

=== Import an OpenAPI specification
One of the most powerful features of APIM is its ability to import an OpenAPI specification to create an API. When you import an existing specification you do not have to complete all the fields required when you create a new API.

To import an API from OpenAPI:

* If the OpenAPI specification is a file, select *IMPORT FILE* and browse your file system to select it.

image::apim/3.x/api-publisher-guide/manage-apis/graviteeio-import-openapi-file.png[Import from definition file, 300]

* If the OpenAPI specification is a link, select *IMPORT FROM LINK*, choose *Swagger / OpenAPI* and enter the definition URL.

==== Vendor extensions
You can use a vendor extension to add more information to OpenAPI specifications about your API.
To do this, you need to add the `x-graviteeio-definition` field at the root of the specification.
The value of this field is an `object` that follows this link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gravitee-io/gravitee-api-management/master/gravitee-apim-rest-api/gravitee-apim-rest-api-service/src/main/resources/schema/xGraviteeIODefinition.json[JSON Schema^]

[NOTE]
====
* `categories` must contain either a key or an id. Only existing categories are imported.
* Import will fail if `virtualHosts` are already in use by *other* APIs.
* If set, `virtualHosts` will override `contextPath`.
* `groups` must contain group names. Only existing groups are imported.
* `metadata.format` is case-sensitive. Possible values are:
** STRING
** NUMERIC
** BOOLEAN
** DATE
** MAIL
** URL
* `picture` only accepts Data-URI format (see example below).
====

Here is an example:
```yaml
openapi: "3.0.0"
info:
  version: 1.2.3
  title: Gravitee.io Echo API
  license:
    name: MIT
servers:
  - url: https://demo.gravitee.io/gateway/echo
x-graviteeio-definition:
  categories:
    - supplier
    - product
  virtualHosts:
    - host: api.gravitee.io
      path: /echo
      overrideEntrypoint: true
  groups:
    - myGroupName
  labels:
    - echo
    - api
  metadata:
    - name: relatedLink
      value: http://external.link
      format: URL
  picture: data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7
  properties:
    - key: customHttpHeader
      value: X-MYCOMPANY-ID
  tags:
    - DMZ
    - partner
    - internal
  visibility: PRIVATE
paths:
...
```

==== Policies on path
When importing an OpenAPI definition, you can select the option *Create policies on path* in the import form.
This specifies that all routes declared in the OpenAPI specification are to be automatically created in APIM.
You can navigate to the policy management view to check.

image::apim/3.x/api-publisher-guide/manage-apis/graviteeio-import-openapi-policies-path.png[Policies view - all routes imported]

You can also choose to activate policies that will be configured using the OpenAPI specification.

JSON Validation::
For each operation, if an `application/json` request body exists, then a JSON schema is computed from this body to configure a JSON Validation policy. +
REQUEST only +
More information is available link:/apim/3.x/apim_policies_json_validation.html[here].

REST to SOAP transformer::
For each operation, if the definition contains some specific vendor extensions, a REST to SOAP policy can be configured. +
These extensions are:
- `x-graviteeio-soap-envelope`: contains the SOAP envelope
- `x-graviteeio-soap-action`: contains the SOAP action
+
REQUEST only +
More information is available link:/apim/3.x/apim_policies_rest2soap.html[here].

Mock::
For each operation, a mock policy is configured, based on the `example` field if it exists, or by generating a random value for the type of the attribute to mock. +
REQUEST only +
More information is available link:/apim/3.x/apim_policies_mock.html[here].

Validation Request::
For each operation, `NOT__ __NULL` rules are created with query parameters and headers. +
REQUEST only +
More information is available link:/apim/3.x/apim_policies_request_validation.html[here]-

XML Validation::
For each operation, if a `application/xml` request body exists, then a XSD schema is computed from this body to configure an XML Validation policy. +
REQUEST only +
More information is available link:/apim/3.x/apim_policies_xml_validation.html[here].

=== Import a WSDL

APIM can import a WSDL to create an API. This means you do not have to declare all the routing and policies to interact with your service.

To import an API from a WSDL:

* If the WSDL is a file, select *IMPORT FILE* and browse your file system to select it.
* If the WSDL is a link, select *IMPORT FROM LINK*, choose *WSDL* and enter the definition URL.

image::apim/3.x/api-publisher-guide/manage-apis/graviteeio-import-wsdl-rest-to-soap-options.png[Import from WSDL link]

If you select the option *Apply REST to SOAP Transformer policy* in addition to the option *Create policies on path* in the import form, a REST-To-SOAP policy will be generated for each path. These policies provide a SOAP envelope for each method with sample data that you can change using expression language. An XML-to-JSON policy will also be generated to convert the entire SOAP response to JSON format.

image::apim/3.x/api-publisher-guide/manage-apis/graviteeio-import-wsdl-rest-to-soap-policy.png[WSDL REST to SOAP policy]

== Manage your API

The API is created private, so it is only accessible in APIM Portal to users after you:

* Publish it
* Make it public or add new members or groups to it

The process for adding new members or groups to the API is explained in link:/apim/3.x/apim_publisherguide_manage_members.html[API users and ownership^].

You can publish the API or make it public, as well as remove it from APIM Portal or delete it, in the *Danger Zone*:

image::apim/3.x/api-publisher-guide/manage-apis/danger-zone.png[]

== Organize your APIs into categories
You can create _categories_ to group APIs. The purpose of categories is to group APIs so consumers can easily find the APIs they need in APIM Portal.

image::apim/3.x/api-publisher-guide/manage-apis/graviteeio-manage-apis-categories-1.png[]

You can describe a category with the following characteristics:

- Name
- Description
- Picture
- Markdown page as documentation

image::apim/3.x/api-publisher-guide/manage-apis/graviteeio-manage-apis-categories-2.png[]

Once you have finished describing the category, you select the APIs you want to include in it.

image::apim/3.x/api-publisher-guide/manage-apis/graviteeio-manage-apis-categories-3.png[]

You can also choose to highlight a particular API. This API will be shown at the top of the category page.

image::apim/3.x/api-publisher-guide/manage-apis/graviteeio-manage-apis-categories-4.png[]
image::apim/3.x/api-publisher-guide/manage-apis/graviteeio-manage-apis-categories-4.png[]
The next time you enter labels for an API, APIM Console makes suggestions based on your registered labels.

image::apim/3.x/api-publisher-guide/manage-apis/graviteeio-manage-apis-labels-2.png[]

You can search for APIs by label.

image::apim/3.x/api-publisher-guide/manage-apis/graviteeio-manage-apis-labels-3.png[]
