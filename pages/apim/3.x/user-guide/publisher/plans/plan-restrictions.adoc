== Configure restrictions

You configure restrictions on the **Restrictions** page of a new or existing plan.

. To edit an existing plan:
  .. In APIM Console, select your API.
  .. Click **Portal > Plans**.
  .. Click the edit icon image::icons/edit-icon.png[role="icon"]
. On the **Restrictions** page, configure the restrictions for the plan, as described in the sections below.
. Click **SAVE** to save your plan.

NOTE: For some APIs created in earlier versions of APIM, you can click **NEXT** to configure plan policies.
+
APIM adds the plan to the list of **Staging** plans.

=== Limit request traffic

Plans provide tools for maintaining and optimizing traffic management and protecting the health of the API backend.

==== Rate-limiting

You can rate limit how many HTTP requests an application can make in a specified period of seconds or minutes.

In the following example, the plan enforces a limit of 1000 requests per minute:

NOTE: Rate-limiting helps you prevent sudden increases in the number of requests at any point in time.

==== Quotas

A quota specifies the number of requests allowed to call an API backend during a specified time interval.

In the following example, the plan enforces a limit of 100000 requests per day:

NOTE: You can use quotas to enforce business or financial requirements to limit the number of calls partner or third-party apps can make in a period of time.

=== Resource filtering

You can use resource filtering to limit access to a subset of API resources.

In the following example, the plan only allows GET requests:

NOTE: You can use resource filtering to make an API read-only for public members and give premium members access to more resources.
