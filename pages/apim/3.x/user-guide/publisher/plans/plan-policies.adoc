NOTE: From APIM 3.5.x, the recommended method for adding policies to plans is with link:{{ '/apim/3.x/apim_publisherguide_design_studio_create.html#flow-policies' | relative_url }}[Design Studio^].

. Click the design icon image:icons/design-icon.png[role="icon"].

APIM opens the plan in Design Studio, where you can configure flows and policies, as described in the link:{{ '/apim/3.x/apim_publisherguide_design_studio_create.html' | relative_url }}[Design Studio Guide].

== Configure policies on the Policies page of a plan

In some APIs created in earlier versions of APIM, you configure policies on the **Policies** page of a new or existing plan.
You can configure a single policy, or a chain of policies. Policy chains can be of the same or different types.

. To edit an existing plan:
  .. In APIM Console, select your API.
  .. Click **Portal > Plans**.
  .. Click the edit icon image:icons/edit-icon.png[role="icon"]. On the **Policies** page:
.. Choose a policy type from the list and click *ADD*.

+
.. Depending on the policy type, specify any other required details of the policy.
.. If you want to create a policy chain, repeat the same steps for each policy in the chain.
. Click **SAVE** to save your plan.
