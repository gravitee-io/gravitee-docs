== Overview
This page explains how to migrate your existing API to Design Studio.

The migration process transforms each `Path`-`HTTP methods`-`Policy` into one flow.

For more information on the differences between the APIM Console *Design* function and Design Studio, see link:{{ '/apim/3.x/apim_publisherguide_design_studio_overview.html#differences' | relative_url }}[Differences between Design function and Design Studio^].

=== Migration rules
The migration rules are the following:

* One flow is created per path.
* If all the policies in a path have the same set of HTTP Methods, then the created flow is configured to accept only the same set of HTTP Method.
* If the policies in a path have different sets of HTTP Methods
** then the created flow is configured to accept only the union of these sets.
Example:

  "/path": [{
    "policy1": {...},
    "methods": ["GET", "POST"],
    ...
  },
  {
    "policy2": {...},
    "methods": ["GET", "DELETE"],
    ...
  }]
+
The created flow will accept the HTTP Methods GET, DELETE and POST.
** A condition is added on each policy of the flow to check the HTTP Method, to match the configuration of each policy from v1 definition.
Example:

  {
    "path-operator": {
      "operator": "STARTS_WITH",
      "path": "/path"
    },
    "methods": ["GET", "DELETE", "POST"],
    "pre": [{
      "name": "policy1",
      "condition": "{#request.method == 'GET' || #request.method == 'POST'}",
      ...
    },{
      "name": "policy2",
      "condition": "{#request.method == 'GET' || #request.method == 'DELETE'}",
      ...
    }],
    ...
  }
