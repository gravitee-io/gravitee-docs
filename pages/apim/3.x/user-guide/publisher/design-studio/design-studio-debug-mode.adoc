[label label-version]#New in version 3.16#

== Overview

From 3.16, we've updated the try it mode to offer new capabilities and view what's happening on each policy executed, now called Debug mode.

Debug mode is a tool for troubleshooting your API proxies running on APIM. It provides detailed information about the behavior of each policy in your flows as well as the overall execution order at runtime. With debug, you can:

* Understand which policies are triggered by a specific request (including Platform-level policies).
* Visualise which policies are executed or skipped (conditional policy).
* Understand the order of execution of your policies.
* Trace transformations and changes made to headers, body and execution context.
* Easily troubleshoot and find root cause of errors, misbehaviors or performance issues.

== How to Get Started With Debug Mode

. Select *Debug* tab.
. Configure your request.
. Select *Send*.

== How To Test Your API Concept with Debug Mode

You can send a request to your *API* endpoint through the embedded HTTP client available under the *Debug* tab.

NOTE: You don't need to save or redeploy the API to test your changes when using the Debug Mode.

The embedded HTTP client let's you configure different attributes of your request:

* *HTTP method* to select the HTTP verb (e.g., `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, etc.).
* *Path* to test a specific subpath and provide query parameters. 

NOTE: The context-path of the API your are debugging is already taken into account. Path refers to the subpath: myapi-context-path/*path*?queryparam=value

* *Headers* to provide a custom list of HTTP request headers.
* *Request body* to configure a custom request body. 

Since debug mode emulates an external call to your API, it will resolve the flow as the gateway would do, so if you want to debug a specific flow you must configure your request (path, headers) to replicate the conditions at which the flow is triggered.

The debug mode displays all policies in a vertical timeline so you can easily visualize the exact order of execution.

=== Different state for policies :

* *executed* - the policy has been executed properly
* *skipped* - the policy contains a condition that has been fulfilled. Refer to the input/output inspector for more details on the evaluation of the condition.
* *error* - an error occurred during policy execution. Refer to the input/output inspector for more details on the error.

By selecting a specific policy in the timeline, you have access to additional information regarding the input/output of the policy:

* header
* context attributes
* body

The inspector relies on 3 colors to indicate the nature of the change:

* *green* color indicates a addition
* *orange* color indicates a edition
* *red* color indicates a deletion

=== Timeline

==== How to interpret ?

The order in which the policies appear in the timeline reflects the exact order in which they have been executed by the gatewau at runtime. 

Note that *this order may differ* from the order in which policies where placed in the Policy Studio during the design phase. 

This is due to a performance optimization applied at runtime on the the policy chain. The gateway always executes policies interacting with the HTTP Header part of the request (onRequest, onResponse) before policies interacting with the body part of the request (onRequestContent, onResponseContent).

Also, a policy may appear twice in the timeline if it interacts with both the head and the body part of the request.

==== How to navigate ?

You can scroll through the list of policies via the timeline. You can also quickly access a specific policy by clicking on a specific policy in the quick access timeline.

By clicking *Request Input* or *Request Output*, you can view the global transformation on your request and difference between what's have been received by the gateway and what's sent to your backend.

By clicking *Response Input* or *Response Output*, you can view the global transformation on your response and difference between what's been received from the backend and what's sent back to your client app.

== Limitations

Some features are not testable with Debug Mode:

* *Rate Limit & quota policies*
* *Spike arrest*
* *Cache* - cache policy will not be testable through debug mode with in memory cache since it is created and destroyed with the api
* *IPFiltering* - Since calls are emited by the gateway itself, you will not be able to emulate a call from another IP with the debug mode (IP used to issue requests is 127.0.0.1)
* *Health-check*
* *Virtual hosts* - the first host is always selected
