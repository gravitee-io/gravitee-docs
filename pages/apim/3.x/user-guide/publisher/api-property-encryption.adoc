== How To Add API Properties
With Gravitee APIM, you can add and encrypt properties that are local to the API by taking advantage of key-value pairings. Get the most out of this feature and comply with your organization's security requirements by adding these properties to policies afterwards. Note **values are unencrypted by default.** 

=== Step 1
First, select an API, then click on the **Design** tab. Once this tab is open, select the **Properties** tab in the upper right corner. 

=== Step 2 
Now, add a property by creating your key and value.

NOTE: Values are **not** encrypted by default. If the value is not encrypted, you can edit the value contents at any time. 

=== Step 3
Choose whether or not to encrypt the API property. 

* To encrypt the property, turn the slide button on before clicking the **+** button. **PRO-TIP:** The value will remain unencrypted and editable until you save your changes. 
* If you do not want the property to be encrypted, do not turn on this slide button.

=== Step 4 
Click the **+** sign to add your property, then click **Save** in the lower left corner of the page so the system retains your changes. **If you do not click save, no changes will be retained.** 

Now, you can redeploy your API.

The value remains unencrypted and editable until you click **Save.** Once you click save, you can no longer edit, modify, or view the value. 

WARNING: Encrypted values can still be used by API Policies (under the *Design* tab) and **APIM Gateway will automatically decrypt these values**. Pay special attention to how you use encrypted data in policies. 

=== Step 5 (Optional)
Now, you can apply your property to a policy. To experiment with this feature, you can add your property to the body of a Mock Policy. 

Use this syntax for your property: `{#properties['property_name']}`

WARNING: Remember, encrypted values can still be used by API Policies (under the *Design* tab) and **APIM Gateway will automatically decrypt these values**. Be especially careful when using encrypted data in policies. 

=== Step 6 
Lastly, you'll need to reset the secret key. The method of encryption used for API properties is based on the default secret key in the 'gravitee.yml` config file which you must override to ensure proper security. 

WARNING: Do not use this default secret key. **Instead, set your own custom 32-byte length secret in the 'gravitee.yml' config file.**

**PRO-TIP:** The secret must be **32 bytes in length.**
