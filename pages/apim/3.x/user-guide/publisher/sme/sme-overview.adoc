== Why Service Management Ecosystem? 

API Gateways are evolving; the adoption of micro-services to gain agility and increased pace of innovation has created the need for new technologies and protocols such as service mesh and gRPC.

The corresponding explosion of data requires the adoption of Event-Driven Architectures (EDA) and real-time processing capabilities (such as Apache Kafka) to keep up with the growing need for fast decision making, while also meeting the expectations of real-time user experience from service consumers.

Also, the proliferation of IoT devices and the emergence of the latest generation of mobile network (5g) creates new opportunities for disruptive business models.

In this context, API Gateways are due to evolve in order to embrace these modern architectures and technologies that go beyond traditional HTTP APIs. Gravitee.io Service Management Ecosystem (SME) is designed to enable you to embrace ever increasing complexities and apply consistent and effortless governance on top of both traditional and event-driven APIs.

Service Management Ecosystem (SME) enables you to go beyond REST API and embrace modern protocols and backend services to future-proof your API Strategy.

== What is SME?

The SME is composed of a Connector API which provides a framework to allow for any backend protocol to be proxied through the Gravitee API Gateway. The Gravitee.io gateway can now be used as a protocol mediation layer between consumers of service and backend services.

In addition, the SME will also provide a set of connectors implementing the Connector API in the form of plugins. A plugin consists of a single unit of code/package that can be deployed onto the platform (e.g Kafka, HTTP, MQTT, JDBC) giving you the flexibility to only deploy the connector(s) needed for your use case(s).
