== Overview

The Kafka connector implements the SME Connector API in order to provide native integration with Apache Kafka. This connector can be leveraged in the following ways depending on your use case:

* Ingest data by exposing an endpoint that transforms requests into messages that are published into an Apache Kafka topic.

* Stream your Kafka events to consumers thanks to web-friendly protocols such as HTTP or Websocket, and provide real-time integration capability to your ecosystem.

== Getting started

This guide will take you through creating a Kafka endpoint, describe how to produce and consume messages and provide the details of all the configuration options available to you.

=== Prerequisites

* You must have installed the Kafka plugin, following the standard procedure for installing plugins detailed link:/apim/3.x/apim_installguide.html[here]
* A basic understanding of Kafka is required, this link:https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/[link] is a good resource to get you started.

=== Creating a Kafka endpoint

You have the two following options when creating a Kafka endpoint:

* You can create it via a `curl` command in API Management, or
* You can import an API definition using the Gravitee console.

==== Creating a Kafka endpoint using API Management

Use standard API Management functionality to create an API endpoint (see link:/apim/3.x/apim_publisherguide_create_apis.html[here] for more detail on creating APIs)

[source,json]

curl -H "Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=" \
     -H "Content-Type:application/json;charset=UTF-8" \
     -X POST \
     -d '"proxy": {"virtual_hosts": [{"path": "/kafka"}],"strip_context_path": false,"preserve_host":false,"groups": [{"name": "default-group","endpoints": [{"backup": false,"inherit": true,"name": "default","weight": 1,"type": "kafka","target": "[YOUR_KAFKA_HOST]"}],"load_balancing": {"type": "ROUND_ROBIN"},"http": {"connectTimeout": 5000,"idleTimeout": 60000,"keepAlive": true,"readTimeout": 10000,"pipelining": false,"maxConcurrentConnections": 100,"useCompression": true,"followRedirects": false}}]},' \

Once created, you can access the Kafka connector configuration via the console, go to your API > Proxy > Endpoints.
