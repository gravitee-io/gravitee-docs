== Overview

You can use the APIM Console messaging feature to communicate with your users. You can send notifications at the level of the entire APIM platform or a specific API.

There are three types of platform-wide and API notifications:

* Portal notifications
* Email notifications
* POST HTTP message notifications

You define the audience for your notifications in terms of roles, as described in the section below.
For a detailed explanation of roles in APIM, see link:/apim/3.x/apim_adminguide_roles_and_permissions.html[Roles and permissions^].

=== Platform-wide notifications

You send APIM platform-wide notifications with the *Messages* menu option:

You can send platform-wide notifications to users defined with the following link:/apim/3.x/apim_adminguide_roles_and_permissions.html#scope[environment scope^] roles:

* ADMIN
* API_PUBLISHER
* USER

=== API notifications

NOTE: You can only send API notifications to consumers with a valid subscription to your API applications.

You send API notifications with the API *Messages* menu option:

You can send API notifications to users defined with the following link:/apim/3.x/apim_adminguide_roles_and_permissions.html#scope[application scope^] roles:

* PRIMARY_OWNER
* USER

== Send a notification

=== Portal notification

When sending *Portal* notifications, you need to specify:

* the user role to notify
* the title of the notification
* the text of the notification

When you click *SEND*, APIM sends the notification to all users belonging to the specified role (as long as they have a valid application subscription, in the case of API level subscriptions). They can access the notification in APIM Console, by clicking the bell in the top bar.

The notification is also visible in the notifications area of the system, if enabled for the browser:

=== Email notification

When sending *Email* notifications, you specify the same information as for portal notifications.

When you click *SEND*, APIM sends an email to all the users with the specified role who have an email address configured for their profile (as long as they have a valid application subscription, in the case of API level subscriptions).

TIP: For more details on configuring user profiles, see link:/apim/3.x/apim_adminguide_users_and_groups[Users and groups^].

=== HTTP POST notification

When sending *POST HTTP message* notifications, you need to specify:

* HTTP headers
* whether a system proxy is to be used
* the URL to use for the HTTP message
* the text of the message

When you click *SEND*, APIM sends the message to the URL, including any HTTP headers specified.
