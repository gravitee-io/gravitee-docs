API rating is a good way to promote your APIs. Only members of the API with correct permissions are allowed to rate it.

Permission RATING:

- CREATE: users can give a rating from 0 to 5
- READ: users can see the ratings of the API
- UPDATE: users can add a comment to their rating
- DELETE: users can delete any comment

A member can also answer a rating.

Permission RATING_ANSWER:

- CREATE: users can answer a rating
- READ: users can see the rating answers of the API
- DELETE: users can delete any answer

By default, API rating is disabled. To enable it, configure `gravitee.yml` as follows:

[source,yaml]
----
...
# Allows to rate an API (default value: false)
rating :
  enabled: true
----
