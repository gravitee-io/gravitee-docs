== Overview

APIM comes with some default common _resources_, for standard APIM usage. The default resources are described in this section.

You can configure resources for your APIs during the API design phase. From APIM 3.5, the recommended way of doing this is with link:/apim/3.x/apim_publisherguide_design_studio_overview.html[Design Studio^].
