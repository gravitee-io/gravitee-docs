== Overview

When as API is defined as a private API, it cannot be accessed through APIM Portal and, consequently, not be subscribed to either.

If you want to give access to a private API, the way to do this is by managing its members.

NOTE: Only users with the required permissions can manage an application's members. For more details, see link:/apim/3.x/apim_adminguide_roles_and_permissions.html[Roles and permissions].

== Roles

By default, APIM includes three membership roles:

[cols="2*", options="header"]
|===
^|Role
^|Description

.^| *Primary Owner*
.^| When an API is created, the Primary Owner is the creator of the API. A Primary Owner can perform all possible actions on an API.

.^| *Owner*
.^| Owner is similar to the Primary Owner role. An Owner can perform all the same actions on an API apart from change the context-path of the API or delete it.

.^| *User*
.^| A User is a person who can access the API and subscribe to it through a plan.
