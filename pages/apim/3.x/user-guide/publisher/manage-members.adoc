== Overview

When you first create your API, by default it is defined as a private API and cannot be accessed through APIM Portal or subscribed to.

If you want to grant specific users or groups access to a private API, the way to do this is by managing its members.

NOTE: Only users with the required permissions can manage an application's members. For more details, see link:{{ '/apim/3.x/apim_adminguide_roles_and_permissions.html' | relative_url }}[Roles and permissions].

== Roles

By default, APIM includes three membership roles:

[cols="2*", options="header"]
|===
^|Role
^|Description

.^| *Primary Owner*
.^| When an API is created, the Primary Owner is the creator of the API. A Primary Owner can perform all possible actions on an API.

.^| *Owner*
.^| Owner is similar to the Primary Owner role. An Owner can perform all the same actions on an API apart from change the context-path of the API or delete it.

.^| *User*
.^| A User is a person who can access the API and subscribe to it through a plan.

== Transfer ownership

You can transfer ownership of an API or application from one user to another. You do this when the current Primary Owner leaves a project, for example.

NOTE: From APIM 3.7, you can also transfer ownership to a group, depending on your configuration. For more details, see link:{{ '/apim/3.x/apim_adminguide_users_and_groups.html#primary_owner_mode' | relative_url }}[Configure primary owners as groups^].

. In APIM Console, click *APIs* or *Applications* in the left menu.
. If you want to transfer ownership for an:
** application, click *Applications* in the menu, then select your application and click *Members*.
** API, click *APIs* in the menu, then select your API and click *Portal > Transfer ownership*.
+
. Choose the new Primary Owner or Primary Owner Group.
+
[NOTE]
====
You can only select a Primary Owner Group which you belong to.
If your Primary owner mode is configured as *GROUP*, you can only select a Primary Owner Group and not a user.
====

. Choose the new role of the current Primary Owner, if the current Primary Owner is a user.
