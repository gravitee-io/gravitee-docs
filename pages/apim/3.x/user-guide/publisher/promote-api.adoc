== Overview

The following sections describe how you can promote an API from one environment to another.

For a quick introduction on how to create an API in APIM, see link:/apim/3.x/apim_publisherguide_create_apis.html[Create an API^].

NOTE: This feature is available from APIM 3.10.0 and requires your installation to be linked to Cockpit. For more information about Cockpit, see link:/cockpit/1.x/cockpit_overview_introduction.html[Cockpit].

*APIs can only be promoted to environments belonging to the same organization.*

== Context

* Two installations
** One linked to Demo and Production environments.
** Another one linked to Dev and QA environments.
** An API to promote.

== Request Promotion For An API

Here, we will see how to promote our API from environment `DEV` to environment `QA`.

To request a promotion, you only need to have *API-DEFINITION* link:/apim/3.x/apim_adminguide_roles_and_permissions.html[permissions^].

Promotion requests are logged in link:/apim/3.x/apim_publisherguide_audit.html[Audits trail^].

The following actions must be done with an API Publisher on `DEV` environment.

. Go to the API to promote and click the image:icons/promote-button.png[role="icon"] button.

+

NOTE: If a promotion request already exists for your API on an environment, you cannot do another request until the previous one is rejected or accepted.
+

+
. Choose the environment you want to promote the API on, then click on *PROMOTE* button

NOTE: When promoting an API, *members* and *groups* information are lost.

NOTE: If a promotion has already been accepted for an API, you can request a new one on the same target environment. Once this promotion is accepted, the API on the target environment will be updated.

== Accepting Or Rejecting A Promotion

To be able to accept or reject a promotion, you need to have *ENVIRONMENT-API* link:/apim/3.x/apim_adminguide_roles_and_permissions.html[permissions^].

As a user of `QA` environment, promotion requests are visible in the *Tasks* section.

. Go to the *Tasks* section.
+

+
. You can choose to accept or reject the promotion.
** Rejecting the promotion will Remove the task.
** Accepting the promotion will:
*** Create or update the API (depending on if it has already been promoted or not).
*** Remove the task.
