== Overview

The following sections describes the process of creating and updating your API through our management API and provide examples of integration into a CI/CD workflow.

== API definition

=== What is an API definition?

An API definition is a JSON representation of your API and its content (e.g., plans, pages, metadata).

=== How to get an API definition?

You can get the API definition by exporting it from the APIM console.
Or, by using the export endpoint `**GET /apis/{api.id}/export**`
(link:{{ '/apim/3.x/management-api/' | relative_url | append: current_version | append: '/index.html#operation/exportApiDefinition' }}[API reference^]).

=== What does it contain ?

In this definition each entity (e.i, API, plan or page) has:

- A **crossId** that identifies the entity (e.i, API, plan or page) across environments:
meaning that the same entity will keep its `crossId` from one environment to another.

TIP: You can find an API by its crossId, using the `getApis` endpoint by providing the `crossId` as a query paramater.
`**GET /apis?crossId=my-cross-id**`
(link:{{ '/apim/3.x/management-api/' | relative_url | append: current_version | append: '/index.html#operation/getApis' }}[API reference^]).

- A technical **id** that uniquely identifies an entity in one environment only:
The same entity will have a different technical id from one environment to another

NOTE: The API import process relies on the **crossId** to match entities with existing ones.
The technical **id** is used during the import only if the **crossId** is not provided. For example in case of an old exported API definition.

== Import and update business rules

The sections below describe the business rules applied during import and update process.

For clarity, the following terminology is used:

* **Imported API**: the API definition you are trying to import.
* **Target API**: an API definition that may already exists in the environment with the same `crossID` as the **Imported API**.

=== Plans

* Plans in Imported API that already exist in the Target API will be _updated_ (plan's status _remains unchanged_).
* Plans in Imported API that do not exist in the Target API will be _created_.
* Plans without subscriptions in Target API that are not present in the Imported API will be _deleted_.

=== Pages

* Pages in Imported API that already exist in the Target API will be _updated_.
* Pages in Imported API that do not exist in the target API will be _created_.
* Pages in Target API that are not present in the Imported API _remains unchanged_.

=== Groups, Members and roles

Depending on your installation setup, group, members and roles will not be imported the same way.

* When using the import feature to update or create an API on the same environment, members, groups and roles can be edited, and group memberships are _preserved_.

* When importing on another environment, groups unknown to the target environment will be _created_, but their memberships will _not be preserved_.

* When importing on another environment that runs on the same APIM instance (same database), direct members will be _preserved_ on the target environment.

* When importing on another environment that runs on a separate APIM instance, direct members _will not be preserved_ and group that are unknown to the target environment will be _created without preserving their memberships_.


== Endpoints for managing your APIs

This section describes the different endpoints your can use to manage your APIs.

They require the target organization and environment in the prefix:
`/organizations/**{organization.id}**/environments/**{environment.id}**/`

=== Creating a new API from an API definition

`**POST /api/import**`
(link:{{ '/apim/3.x/management-api/' | relative_url | append: current_version | append: '/index.html#operation/importApiDefinition' }}[API reference^]).

The HTTP request body can contain :

* the JSON API definition
* **OR** an HTTP link to the JSON API definition

NOTE: An error is raised if an API with same **crossId** already exists on the target environment.

=== Exporting an existing API

Use the following endpoint to export an API definition:

`**GET /apis/{api.id}/export**`
(link:{{ '/apim/3.x/management-api/' | relative_url | append: current_version | append: '/index.html#operation/exportApiDefinition' }}[API reference^])


=== Updating an existing API from an API definition

`**PUT /api/import**`
(link:{{ '/apim/3.x/management-api/' | relative_url | append: current_version | append: '/index.html#operation/updateWithDefinition' }}[API reference^])

This method relies on the **crossId** provided as part of the Imported API definition to eventually match your API to an existing API in the target environment.

NOTE: An error is raised if the **crossId** of the Imported API matches with an existing API on the target environment.

WARNING: Endpoint  `**PUT /apis/{api.id}/import**`
(link:{{ '/apim/3.x/management-api/' | relative_url | append: current_version | append: '/index.html#operation/updateWithDefinitionPUT' }}[API reference^]) based on the technical **id** (passed as a path parameter) can still be used, but is no longer the recommended option.

=== Partially update an API

This endpoint lets you update only a part of an existing API definition and its sub-resources.

`**PATCH /apis/{api.id}/definition**`

Refer to this link:{{ '/apim/3.x/apim_publisherguide_partial_update_apis.html' | relative_url}}[section^] for more details.

== CI/CD use cases examples

=== Create your API on development environment

Create your API in development environment, using the APIM console.

=== Push your API to the production environment

* Get your API definition by exporting it from APIM console, or using the export endpoint. For example :

     -H "Content-Type:application/json;charset=UTF-8" \
     -X GET \
