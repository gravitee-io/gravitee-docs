== System Requirements

=== JDK

Gravitee.io Alert Engine is supporting from Java 8 to latest Java 11. Before you install it, please check your Java version :

[source,bash]
----
java -version
echo $JAVA_HOME
----

NOTE: You can download the latest OpenJDK from https://jdk.java.net/archive/[OpenJDK Download Site].

== Installing from the ZIP archive

Binaries are available from https://download.gravitee.io/graviteeio-ae/components/gravitee-ae-engine/gravitee-ae-standalone-{{site.products.ae.version}}.zip.

[source,bash]
[subs="attributes"]
$ curl -L https://download.gravitee.io/graviteeio-ae/components/gravitee-ae-engine/gravitee-ae-standalone-{{site.products.ae.version}}.zip -o gravitee-ae-standalone-{{site.products.ae.version}}.zip

Once file has been downloaded, you just have to unpack it in the right place.

[source,bash]
[subs="attributes"]
$ unzip gravitee-ae-standalone-{{site.products.ae.version}}.zip

== Running AE Engine from the command line

AE Engine can be started from the command line as follows:

[source,bash]
----
$ cd gravitee-ae-standalone-{{site.products.ae.version}}
$ ./bin/gravitee
----

By default, AE Engine runs in the foreground, prints its logs to the standard output (stdout), and can be stopped
by pressing Ctrl-C.

If everything goes well, you should see this log:

[source,bash]
[subs="attributes"]
...
11:23:06.835 [main] [] INFO  i.g.ae.standalone.node.AlertEngineNode - Gravitee.io - Alert Engine - Engine id[92c03b26-5f21-4460-803b-265f211460be] version[{{site.products.ae.version}}] pid[4528] build[${env.BUILD_NUMBER}#${env.GIT_COMMIT}] jvm[Oracle Corporation/Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM/25.121-b13] started in 1860 ms.
...

== Checking that AE Engine is running

You can test that your AE Engine node is running by sending an HTTP request to port `8072` on `localhost`:

[source,bash]
----
$ curl -X GET http://localhost:8072/
----

which should give you an empty 401 response

== Running as a daemon

To run AE Engine as a daemon, specify -d on the command line, and record the process ID in a file using the -p option:

[source,bash]
----
$ ./bin/gravitee -d -p=/var/run/gio.pid
----

Log messages can be found in the `$GRAVITEE_HOME/logs/` directory.

To shut down AE Engine, kill the process ID recorded in the pid file:

[source,bash]
----
$ kill `cat /var/run/gio.pid`
----

== Directory structure

After successfully installed AE Engine, the `gravitee-ae-standalone` directory looks like this:
