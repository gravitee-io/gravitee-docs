This section is explaining how to configure the Alert Engine within Gravitee.io Access Management.

- AM comes with an intuitive and easy to use integration of Alert Engine.
- AM provides a pre-defined and pre-configured list of alerts that only have to be enabled or disabled.

NOTE: If you want to change some advanced settings, you can still update the relevant section of the gravitee.yml

      security:
        username: admin
        password: adminadmin
  risk_assessment:
  # You need the Risk Assessment Service plugin for these alerts
    geoVelocity:
      name: Geo velocity alert
