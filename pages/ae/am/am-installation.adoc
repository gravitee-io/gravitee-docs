== Overview
This page explains how to integrate AE with link:https://www.gravitee.io/products/access-management[Gravitee.io Access Management^] (AM).

If you are performing a new installation of Gravitee.io Enterprise API Platform or running Enterprise
Docker images, you can skip the installation section.

IMPORTANT: To integrate AM with AE, your AM platform must
be an link:/ee/ee_introduction.html[Enterprise version].

== Installation

=== Download connector

[source,bash]
[subs="attributes"]
$ curl -L https://download.gravitee.io/graviteeio-ae/plugins/connectors/gravitee-ae-connectors-ws/gravitee-ae-connectors-ws-{{site.products.ae.version}}.zip -o gravitee-ae-connectors-ws-{{site.products.ae.version}}.zip

=== Install connector

In the command below, ${GRAVITEEIO_HOME} refers to the root directory of both the APIM Gateway and APIM API.

[source,bash]
[subs="attributes"]
$ cp gravitee-ae-connectors-ws-{{site.products.ae.version}}.zip ${GRAVITEEIO_HOME}/plugins/

== Configuration

For both AM Gateway and the AM API, you need to configure access to Alert Engine through WebSockets. You can do this with the following configuration:

```yaml
alerts:
  alert-engine:
    enabled: true
    ws:
      discovery: true
      endpoints:
        - http://localhost:8072/
      security:
        username: admin
        password: adminadmin
```

=== Endpoints
You can have as many endpoints as you need. The node will select one of them in round-robin fashion.

=== Discovery mode
Discovery mode is very useful when running a cluster of Alert Engine. By using it, you just have to refer to a single
AE node and the other nodes from the cluster will be automatically registered.
