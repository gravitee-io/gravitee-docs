= Introduction

The Gravitee.io API Platform is a turnkey solution to manage (APIM) and secure (AM) APIs.
It provides a lot of features including the ability to monitor several aspects of your APIs: health-check, availability, response-time and so on...
To be even more complete, this feature needed to be coupled with an alerting component.

And here we are with the Alert Engine (AE) component!

From the Gravitee.io API Management side, this component allows to:

- Notify API Publisher that the health-check service was able/not able to check an endpoint.

- Notify consumers or publishers that they reach a given threshold percentage of the quota.

- Notify administrator(s) that one of the gateway instance is consuming more than XX% of heap or XX% of CPU, a new one is available, or one node is down.

- ... and many others uses cases...


== Gravitee.io Alert Engine

Alert Engine allows users to configure alerts and receive notifications through different channels (emails, slack, ...)
to help them to monitor efficiently their API platform.


The solution does not require any external component as it does not store anything (no database).
AE receives events and is responsible for sending notifications under certain conditions (which have been configured upstream with triggers).
