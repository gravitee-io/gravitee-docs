== Rules

You can define platform alerts which alert you under certain conditions for the runtime nodes (APIM Gateway / APIM API).

These conditions mainly apply to the node status and all the information emanating from it.

== Examples

=== API Gateway CPU > 60%
In the following example configuration, an alert is sent when the CPU of an API Gateway reaches a threshold of 60%:

.API Management - API Gateway CPU > 60%
image::{% link images/ae/apim/api_gateway_alert_threshold_60.png %}[API Gateway CPU > 60%]

=== API Gateway is stopped

The following configuration alerts when an APIM Gateway is stopped:

.API Management - API Gateway stopped
