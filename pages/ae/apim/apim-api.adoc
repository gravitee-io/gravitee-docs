== Overview

This section explains how to configure alerts for an API in APIM.

=== Response time greater than X ms

This example configures an alert for response times to requests exceeding a threshold of 1500ms:

.API Management - Response time > 1500ms
image::{% link images/ae/apim/api_alert_response_time_threshold.png %}[Response time > 1500ms]

=== Invalid API key

This example configures an alert for invalid API keys:

.API Management - Invalid API key
image::{% link images/ae/apim/api_alert_api_key_invalid.png %}[Invalid API-KEY]

=== 50th percentile of response time greater than X ms

This example configures an alert for the 50th percentile of response times exceeding a threshold of 200 ms in the last 5 minutes:

.API Management - Percentile 50 for response time greater than X ms
image::{% link images/ae/apim/api_alert_50percentile.png %}[Percentile 50 for response-time greater than X ms]

=== No API requests in the last minute

The following example configures an alert for no requests made to the API during the last minute:

.API Management - No api request during last minute
image::{% link images/ae/apim/api_alert_api_no_request_last_minute.png %}[No api request during last minute]

=== No API requests from my-application in the last minute

The following example is the same as above, but filters on `my-application`:

.API Management - No API request during last minute
image::{% link images/ae/apim/api_alert_application_no_request_last_minute.png %}[No api request from my-application during last minute]

=== Quota too many requests

This example configures an alert for reaching the quota limit on requests:

.API Management - Quota too many requests
image::{% link images/ae/apim/api_alert_quota_too_many_requests.png %}[Quota too many requests]

=== Too many errors in the last 5 minutes

This example configures an alert for the number of 5xx errors reaching a threshold of 10 in the last 5 minutes:

.API Management - Api too many errors
image::{% link images/ae/apim/api_alert_api_too_many_errors.png %}[Api too many errors]
