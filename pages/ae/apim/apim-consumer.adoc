== Overview

This section explains how to configure alerts for a consumer through applications in APIM.

You can set up these alerts in APIM Portal and create a maximum of 10 alerts by application.

== Notification

When creating an alert for an application, all the members of the applications (direct members or through associated groups) with a configured email will receive an email notification if an alert is triggered.

== Type of alerts

You can configure two types of alerts.

=== Response time greater than X ms

This example shows the configuration of an alert for response times for requests exceeding a threshold of 1500 ms during the last 5 minutes:

.API Management - Response time > 1500 ms
image::{% link images/ae/apim/consumer_alert_response_time_threshold.png %}[Response time > 1500 ms]

=== Rate of HTTP statuses during a period

You can configure alert on ranges of statuses (1XX, 2XX, 3XX, 4XX, 5XX) or directly on a precise status.

This example shows the configuration an alert for a rate of HTTP status 5XX (Server error) greater than 75% during the last 10 minutes:

.API Management - 5XX HTTP status > 75%
