This section outline the changes that you need to be aware of when migrating your application from one version of Gravitee.io Access Management to another.

== Design differences in 2.x

The main changes with the 1.x version is that the Gateway (Authorization Server) and the Management Server have been split into two separate pieces.

The Gateway server has been re-written from scratch and has changed from a IO blocking Servlet model to a non blocking reactive model with the link:https://vertx.io/[Vert.x] tool-kit.
