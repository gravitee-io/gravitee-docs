Gravitee.io Access Management comes with a default security domain called `admin` security domain.
It defines a default `admin` account that have the permission to perform all the Gravitee.io AM management tasks.

We recommend to use the `admin` security domain only to register users of the Gravitee.io AM Management UI and create new security domains to manage the users and clients in your organization business units.
