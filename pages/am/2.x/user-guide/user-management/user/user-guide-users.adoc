Users are created for each security domain, to create a user, follow these steps:

. Go to http://GRAVITEEIO-AM-UI-HOST
. From the homepage, go to your security domain's settings page, go to `Users` section and click `(+)` button
. Give your user a *First name*, a *Last name*, an *Email* and an *Username* and press `SAVE`
. Optional : You can also add/modify specific attributes relating to the user. These user metadata will be available in the user's profile.
. You will be redirected to the created user's page
