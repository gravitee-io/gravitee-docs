== Introduction

Extension Points allow you to extend the behavior of the Access Management Server by executing link:{{ '/apim_overview_plugins.html#gravitee-plugins-policies' | relative_url }}[Policy] on selected stages.

NOTE: Unlike Gravitee.io API Management link:{{ '/apim_policies_overview.html' | relative_url }}[Policies] and its API `OnRequest/OnResponse` gateway proxy chain, Gravitee.io Access Management supports only policy with the `OnRequest` step.
See more information about the policies link:{{ '/apim_devguide_policies.html' | relative_url }}[here].

== Execution Context

Each policy has access to the `Execution Context` to retrieve and set information required to execute the policy code.

Those `Execution Context` data will be propagate to the next steps to be used later on (e.g custom HTML forms).

Here is an example to get `Execution Context` data thanks to the link:{{ '/apim_publisherguide_expression_language.html' | relative_url }}[Gravitee.io Expression Language] :

----
{#request} : Current HTTP Request with parameters, headers, path, ...
{#context.attributes['client']} : OAuth 2.0 Client (if available) with clientId, clientName, ...
{#context.attributes['user']} : Authenticated User (if available) with username, firstName, lastName, email, roles, ...
----

== Extension points

Policies are executed only against selected steps throughout the request process.

The following is a list of the available extension points:

* link:{{ '/am/2.x/am_userguide_policies_extension_points.html#pre_end_user_consent' | relative_url }}[Pre End-User Consent] : happens after the user has logged in. It allows you to fetch more information or validate incoming data before displaying the User Consent HTML Page.
* link:{{ '/am/2.x/am_userguide_policies_extension_points.html#post_end_user_consent' | relative_url }}[Post End-User Consent] : happens after the user has given his consent to the processing of personal data. It allows you to validate incoming data (user consent) before giving access to the application.

NOTE: More extension points will be added to the next releases of Gravitee.io AM.
