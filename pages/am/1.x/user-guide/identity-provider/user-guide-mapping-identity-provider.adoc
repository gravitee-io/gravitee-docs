Attributes mapping let you bind Gravitee.io AM user profile attributes with your identity provider attributes.
This allows you to get all necessary user information available to Gravitee.io AM clients.

== User mappers

Let's say you want the `telephoneNumber` of your authenticated LDAP user, you can do it by configuring your LDAP identity provider :

. Go to http://GRAVITEEIO-AM-UI-HOST
. From the homepage, go to your security domain's settings page, go to `Providers` section
. From the security domain's providers page, select your LDAP identity provider and go to `User mappers` tab
. Map your LDAP (raw) attribute to the user attribute

[start=5]
. Get the user profile information via the UserInfo Endpoint and you will see that the new user attribute is present

[source,bash,subs="verbatim"]
----
curl -X GET http://GRAVITEEIO-AM-GATEWAY-HOST/:securityDomainPath/userinfo -H 'Authorization: Bearer :accesToken'
----

If everything goes well, you should see the following response :

[source]
----
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, max-age=0, must-revalidate
Pragma: no-cache
{
    "uid": "johndoe",
    "given_name": "John",
    "family_name": "Doe"
    "telephone_number: "202-555-0105"
}
----

The same principle applies for any identity providers.

== Role mappers and dynamic OAuth2 scopes

Gravitee.io AM allows you to create roles and permissions for your users. You can map these roles with your identity provider users.
We can imagine that you have a set of users that they belong to department organization groups inside your company.
For example some developers of your organization belong to the LDAP `IT_DEVELOPERS_TEAM` group and you want to give them the `administrator` role for your applications.

You can do it by configuring your LDAP identity provider :

. Go to http://GRAVITEEIO-AM-UI-HOST
. From the homepage, go to your security domain's settings page, go to `Roles` section
. Click (+) button and create `administrator` role with some permissions (like admin, everything, superuser, ...)
. Go back to security domain settings page and go to `Providers` section
. From the security domain's providers page, select your LDAP identity provider and go to `Role mappers` tab
. Set the user's roles configuration

[start=7]
. If you request for an access token, you will see that the scopes will be set with the user roles' permissions values (make sure you set the `Enhance scopes` option for your client).

The same principle applies for any identity providers.
