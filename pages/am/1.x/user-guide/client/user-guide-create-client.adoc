== Client information

=== Settings

image::am/1.x/graviteeio-am-userguide-client-settings.png[]

After you have created the new client, you will be redirected to this client's settings page that contains the following information :

- *Client ID* : The client identifier.
- *Client Secret* : The client secret. Client credentials will let you request and validate access tokens.
- *Auto approval* : Allow to skip user approval. Generally used for internal trusted service applications.
- *Identity providers* : Identity provider use to authenticate the users
- *Grant types* : link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-1.3[OAuth2 grant flows] used for a client to acquire an access token.
- *Redirect URIs* : Set of allowed URLs where the user will be redirected after successfully login to your client. It prevents some vulnerabilities like being redirected to unsafe websites.
- *Scopes* : link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-3.3[Access Token Scope], let you limit client's access to protected resources/APIs.
- *Enhance scope* : Enhance client scopes with user permissions. Useful for fine tuned resources access.
- *Access token validity* : Access token lifetime.
- *Refresh token validity* : Refresh token lifetime. Refresh token is used to request for a new access token.
- *Certificate* : Certificate use to sign tokens.

=== OpenID Connect

Client can request for an access token to access protected resources. It can also request for an link:/am_userguide_concepts.html#id_token[ID Token] that contains profile information of the current authenticated user.
ID Token contains claims which are statements about the user, these claims can be overridden to include specific users attributes defined in the related identity provider.

== Testing client

The fastest way to test your fresh created client is to request for an OAuth2 access token by following the link:/am_quickstart_register_app.html[Register your first client] tutorial.
If you succeed to get an access token, your client is all set.
