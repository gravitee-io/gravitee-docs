== Overview

NOTE: HTTP MFA requires a compatible link:{{ '/am/current/am_userguide_resources.html' | relative_url }}[resource^].

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) can take several forms such as :

* Security key
* FIDO 2 (biometrics)
* Mobile application (TOTP based)
* SMS
* and more

Most of the time, these MFA methods are backed with 3rd party vendors, which each come with pros and cons.
While we recommend that you explore Gravitee Identity and Access Management, we understand that some teams already have a vendor that they are happy with, and we want to make sure that we support those use cases as well.

Our Gravitee MFA HTTP plugin makes that a possibility. With our new Gravitee MFA HTTP plugin you can :

* Easily integrate your existing MFA solution into your Gravitee IAM and APIM strategies
* Bring some customization and offer a better user experience
* Facilitate solution migration
