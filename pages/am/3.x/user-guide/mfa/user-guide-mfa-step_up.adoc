== Overview

Step-up authentication is the process by which the user is challenged to produce additional forms of authentication while already authenticated through the first set of credentials.

Step-up authentication therefore utilizes multi-factor authentication (MFA) and can include any number of authentication methods, including MFA, one-time code over SMS, knowledge-based authentication (KBA), biometrics, etc.

It differs from Multi-factor authentication which is used to ask a user to produce multiple forms of authentication in order to provide a higher level of assurance.

NOTE: Step-up authentication enables you to implement an adaptive authentication scheme that seeks to find the best balance between the risk level of a request with the assurance level of the authentication.

Youâ€™ll then be able to reduce the security friction inherent to multi-factor authentication only when it is needed. It helps you ensure that users can access non sensitive resources with a minimum set of security while prompting them for additional credentials when they request access to sensitive resources.

Here some use cases where Step-up authentication is often used :

- User wants to modify their password
- User initiates a payment
- User wants to delegate access to third parties

== Configure Step-up authentication

. link:/am/current/am_userguide_authentication.html[Log in to AM Console^].
. Select your application
. Click *Settings > Multifactor Auth*.
. Select your MFA factor and set the *Step up authentication* rule.
. Click *SAVE*.

You can leverage access control by asking your users to confirm their identity before making any sensitive actions.
In this example the sensitive action is represented by the `pisp` (Payment Initiation Service Provider) OAuth 2.0 scope.

NOTE: In order to use the API endpoints for payment initiation, an OAuth 2 access token must be presented to the API with the scope `psip`.
This is the standard flow defined by the PSD2 and Open Banking protocols.
Payment initiation requires a *consent process* and a *strong customer authentication*.

NOTE: MFA Step-up authentication is based on our execution context and can be triggered according to the incoming request, the user profile, and more.
