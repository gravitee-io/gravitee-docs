== Overview

Step-up authentication requires users to produce additional forms of authentication when they are already authenticated with a first set of credentials.

Step-up authentication uses multi-factor authentication (MFA), and can include any number of authentication methods, such as a one-time code over SMS, knowledge-based authentication (KBA), and biometrics.

[NOTE]
====
While both step-up authentication and MFA require users to produce multiple forms of authentication, each has a slightly different purpose:

* The purpose of MFA is to increase confidence in a user's identity.
* The purpose of step-up authentication is to increase the level of security when needed: you can use it to implement an adaptive authentication scheme that seeks to find the best balance between the risk level of a request and the confidence level of the authentication.

Step-up authentication helps you ensure that users can access non-sensitive resources with a lower level of authentication, while prompting them for additional credentials when they request access to sensitive resources.

=== Example use cases

Step-up authentication is often used in the following scenarios:

- Users want to modify their password.
- Users initiate a payment.
- Users want to delegate access to third parties.

. Click *Settings > Multifactor Auth*.
. Select your MFA factor and set the *Step up authentication* rule.
. Click *SAVE*.

You can leverage access control by asking your users to confirm their identity before making any sensitive actions.
In this example the sensitive action is represented by the `pisp` (Payment Initiation Service Provider) OAuth 2.0 scope.

NOTE: In order to use the API endpoints for payment initiation, an OAuth 2 access token must be presented to the API with scope `psip`.
This is the standard flow defined by the PSD2 and Open Banking protocols.
Payment initiation requires a *consent process* and a *strong customer authentication*.

NOTE: MFA step-up authentication is based on our execution context and can be triggered according to the incoming request, the user profile, and more.
