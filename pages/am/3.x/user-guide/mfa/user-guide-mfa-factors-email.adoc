== Overview

With Email verification, you can receive a verification code on your email address to be used as the second factor to validate a userâ€™s account.

NOTE: Email MFA requires a compatible link:{{ '/am/current/am_userguide_resources.html' | relative_url }}[resource^].

Using the `email-am-factor` plugin configuration form, you can define the number of digits used to generate the verification code. The configured resource must be a link:{{ '/am/current/am_userguide_resources_smtp.html' | relative_url }}[SMTP Resource]. The email template used by this plugin is defined in the design section of the domain or application.

*Subject* and *Template* fields use the freemarker syntax to customize the message content. The generated *code* is available using the expression `${code}`. The user profile and the application are accessible using the expressions `${user}` and  `${client}` (ex: `${client.clientName}` will return the application name and `${user.firstName}` will return the first name of the user.)

If you enable an Email type factor for your application, next time your users log in they will see the following screens:

NOTE: You can design forms using link:{{ '/am/current/am_userguide_user_management_forms.html' | relative_url }}[Custom forms^]. The enrollment form must send the email address using the `email` parameter.
