Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) provides a method to add an additional step during the login flow in order to enforce access control.
This ensures that only valid users can access their accounts even if they credentials may have been compromised.

To enable MFA, go to your `Security Domain > Multifactor Auth` and create a new MFA Factor (OTP for example).

Next, go to your application and enable MFA by selecting an available factor.
