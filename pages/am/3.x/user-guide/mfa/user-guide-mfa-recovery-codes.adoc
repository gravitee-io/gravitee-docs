The *recovery code* factor generates a set of recovery codes which the user can use to authenticate in case the other options are not available.
The recovery codes are generated and shown only once to the user during the enrollment or login process. It is thus advisable to download and keep the recovery codes in a safe place.

NOTE: The generated recovery codes are alphanumeric and each recovery code can only be used once to ensure greater security.

The image below shows an example recovery code factor configuration.
The configuration is flexible and allows to set the number of recovery codes and the number of digits for each recovery code as per the customer's requirements.
