[label label-version]#New in version 3.18#

== Overview

Since 3.18, Access Management brings up a new way to configure Multi-Factor authentication.

It is composed of four steps:

- The first step allows you to select your link:{{ '/am/current/am_userguide_mfa_factors.html' | relative_url }}[Application Factors^]
- The second step allows you to configure the way end users will be prompted MFA
- The third step allows you to configure link:{{ '/am/current/am_userguide_mfa_remember_device.html' | relative_url }}[Remember device^]
- The last steps allows you to configure  link:{{ '/am/current/am_userguide_mfa_step_up.html' | relative_url }}[Step-Up Authentication^]

While step 1,3,4 are similar prior v3.18, the second step differs.

== Activate MFA

Adaptive access allows you to choose between 4 MFA strategies:

- **OPTIONAL**: The end user can skip MFA for a give amount of time (default is 10 hours)

- **REQUIRED**: The end user will be required to enroll. They will also be challenged at every login.

- **CONDITIONAL**: The end user will be prompted enroll and challenge in regard to link:{{ '/am/current/am_userguide_mfa_amfa.html' | relative_url }}[Adaptive MFA^]

- **RISK-BASED**: [label label-enterprise]#Enterprise feature# The end user will be intelligently prompted MFA based on risk assessments

. `Devices`: Will check the if device of the User across the security domain (Remember Device needs to be activated to collect the user's device)
. `Ip Reputation score`: Will prompt MFA based on the severity of the IP score (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH)
. `Geolocation Velocity`: Will prompt MFA based on the speed between the 2 last login locations (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH)

NOTE: If device assessment is enabled, we won't prompt MFA with `Remember Device` as it would be redundant

In order to have the GeoVelocity working, you will need:

- The link:https://download.gravitee.io/#plugins/services/gravitee-service-geoip/[Gravitee Geoip Plugin] installed in your gateway
- The link:https://download.gravitee.io/#graviteeio-ee/plugins/services/risk-assessment/gravitee-risk-assessment-core/[Risk Assessment Plugin] installed in your gateway
- You will need to activate User activity on both your Gateway and Management API in the `gravitee.yml`

```yml
user:
   activity:
      enabled: true # default is false
      anon: #used to anonymize the user activity
         algorithm: SHA256|SHA512|NONE #default SHA256
         salt: some-salt # default is null meaning the key generated will change every time and data won't be exploitable
      retention:
         time: 3
         unit: MONTHS
      geolocation:
         variation:
            latitude: 0.07 # default to have a geolocation randomised, 0 will give the exact position
            longitude: 0.07 # default to have a geolocation randomised, 0 will give the exact position
```

NOTE: If you enable Brute Force Detection, we will also capture the user login attempts.

WARNING: User activity won't be captured with Social login now due to security reasons.

=== User activity and consent

To capture user activity, the user will have to consent to store the geolocation extracted from the IP
as well as the user_agent.

- `uc_geoip` : consent for IP and geolocation
- `uc_ua` : consent for User Agent

```html
    <input class="mdl-checkbox__input" type="checkbox" th:checked="${uc_geoip}" id="uc_geoip" name="uc_geoip">
    <input class="mdl-checkbox__input" type="checkbox" th:checked="${uc_ua}" id="uc_ua" name="uc_ua">
```

If they already have consented to these, you can simply add those inputs as `hidden` form fields
```html
    <input class="mdl-checkbox__input" type="hidden" value="on" id="uc_geoip" name="uc_geoip">
    <input class="mdl-checkbox__input" type="hidden" value="on" id="uc_ua" name="uc_ua">
```
