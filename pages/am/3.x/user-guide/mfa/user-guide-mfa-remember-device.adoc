== Overview

You can configure AM to register the device a user uses for authentication.
After a successful login attempt, AM adds the trusted device to the user account for a certain period of time and skips MFA as long as the
device is known.

== Configure AM to remember an authentication device

. Configure a link:{{ '/am/current/am_userguide_device_identifier_plugins.html' | relative_url }}[device identifier^].
. In AM Console, select your application.
. Click the **Settings** tab, then click **Multifactor Auth**.
. Toggle on **Enable Remember Device**.
. Enter the details of the device identifier and the amount of time you want to remember the device (2 hours by default).
. Click *SAVE*.
