== Overview

If users lose their mobile device or can't use their authenticator application for any reason, they can ask the security domain administrator to reset their multi-factor authentication (MFA) devices.
The MFA factors associated with their user will be removed and MFA configuration screens (Enroll and Challenge) will be displayed during the next login attempt.
