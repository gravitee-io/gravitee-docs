== Overview

With SMS verification, you can receive a verification code on your mobile phone to be used as the second factor to validate a userâ€™s account.

NOTE: SMS MFA requires a compatible link:{{ '/am/current/am_userguide_resources.html' | relative_url }}[resource^].

TIP: Some providers allow you to define the duration of the code sent by SMS. If possible we advise you to set a duration of 2 minutes.

If you enable an SMS type factor for your application, next time your users log in they will see the following screens:

NOTE: You can change the look and feel of forms using link:{{ '/am/current/am_userguide_user_management_forms.html' | relative_url }}[Custom forms^]. The enrollment form must send the phone number using the `phone` parameter in E.164 notation.
