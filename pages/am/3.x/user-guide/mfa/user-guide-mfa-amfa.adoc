== Overview

Adaptive multi-factor authentication (A-MFA) requires users to produce additional forms of authentication after the login step.

When A-MFA is enabled, it allows the user to skip MFA, based on the following trusted information:

- The IP of the user.
- The number of times the user has logged in.
- The content of the request.

=== Example use cases

A-MFA is often used in the following scenarios:

- A user fails to log in three times and succeeds on the fourth attempt.
- A user tries to log in from a different location (such as country, continent, or region).

You can use A-MFA in both cases to prevent account security breaches.

WARNING: To apply location rules, you must first install plugin link:https://download.gravitee.io/plugins/services/gravitee-service-geoip-1.0.0.zip[`gravitee-service-geoip`].
This plugin loads the `geoip` databases in memory, so you need to adjust the JVM Heap settings of your AM Gateways accordingly.

NOTE: In order to use the Geoip features, you can download the link:https://download.gravitee.io/#graviteeio-am/plugins/repositories/gravitee-service-geoip/[Gravitee Geoip Plugin].

WARNING: The Gravitee Geoip Plugin uses MaxMind, make sure your AM instance is well provisioned in terms of resources.

== Configure A-MFA

. In AM Console, select your application.
. Click the **Settings** tab, then click **Multifactor Auth**.
. Set the *Adaptive MFA* rule.
. Click *SAVE*.
