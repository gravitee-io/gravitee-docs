== Overview
Adaptive Multi-factor authentication (A-MFA) requires the user to produce additional forms of authentication after the login step.

When A-MFA is enabled, it allows the user to skip MFA, based on the following trusted information:

- The IP of the user.
- The number of times the user has logged in
- The content of the request.

=== Example use cases

A-MFA is often used in the following situations:

- A user fails to log in three times and succeeds on the fourth attempt.
- A user tries to log in from a different location (such as country, continent or region).

Both of these can be secured with A-MFA to prevent the account from being compromised.
