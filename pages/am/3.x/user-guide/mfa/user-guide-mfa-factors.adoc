== One-time password

One-Time Password (OTP) allows you to use an Authenticator application via your digital device (mobile phone), such as Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator or Free OTP,
to generate a one-time code which changes over time and will be used as the second factor to validate a user’s account.

If you enable an OTP type factor for your application, next time your users log in they will see the following screens:

image::{% link images/am/current/graviteeio-am-userguide-mfa-challenge.png %}[MFA Challenge]

NOTE: The look and feel of the MFA forms can be overridden. See link:{{ '/am/current/am_userguide_user_management_forms.html' | relative_url }}[Custom forms^] for more information.

== SMS verification

With SMS verification, you can receive a verification code on your mobile phone to be used as the second factor to validate a user’s account.

NOTE: SMS MFA requires a compatible link:{{ '/am/current/am_userguide_resources.html' | relative_url }}[resource^].

TIP: Some providers allow you to define the duration of the code sent by SMS. If possible we advise you to set a duration of 2 minutes.

If you enable an SMS type factor for your application, next time your users log in they will see the following screens:

image::{% link images/am/current/graviteeio-am-userguide-mfa-sms-enroll.png %}[SMS Enroll]

image::{% link images/am/current/graviteeio-am-userguide-mfa-sms-challenge.png %}[SMS Challenge]

NOTE: You can change the look and feel of forms using link:{{ '/am/current/am_userguide_user_management_forms.html' | relative_url }}[Custom forms^]. The enrollment form must send the phone number using the `phone` parameter in E.164 notation.

== Phone call verification

With Phone call verification, you can receive a verification code via a phone call to be used as the second factor to validate a user’s account.

NOTE: Phone call MFA requires a compatible link:{{ '/am/current/am_userguide_resources.html' | relative_url }}[resource^].

If you enable a *Call* type factor for your application, next time your users log in they will see the following screens:

image::{% link images/am/current/graviteeio-am-userguide-mfa-call-enroll.png %}[Call Enroll]

image::{% link images/am/current/graviteeio-am-userguide-mfa-call-challenge.png %}[Call Challenge]

NOTE: You can change the look and feel of forms using link:{{ '/am/current/am_userguide_user_management_forms.html' | relative_url }}[Custom forms^]. The enrollment form must send the phone number using the `phone` parameter in E.164 notation.

== Email verification

With Email verification, you can receive a verification code on your email address to be used as the second factor to validate a user’s account.

NOTE: Email MFA requires a compatible link:{{ '/am/current/am_userguide_resources.html' | relative_url }}[resource^].

Using the `email-am-factor` plugin configuration form, you can define the number of digits used to generate the verification code. The configured resource must be a link:{{ '/am/current/am_userguide_resources_smtp.html' | relative_url }}[SMTP Resource]. The email template used by this plugin is defined in the design section of the domain or application.

image::{% link images/am/current/graviteeio-am-userguide-mfa-email-config.png %}[Email Configuration]

*Subject* and *Template* fields use the freemarker syntax to customize the message content. The generated *code* is available using the expression `${code}`. The user profile and the application are accessible using the expressions `${user}` and  `${client}` (ex: `${client.clientName}` will return the application name and `${user.firstName}` will return the first name of the user.)

If you enable an Email type factor for your application, next time your users log in they will see the following screens:

image::{% link images/am/current/graviteeio-am-userguide-mfa-email-enroll.png %}[Email Enroll]

image::{% link images/am/current/graviteeio-am-userguide-mfa-email-challenge.png %}[Email Challenge]

NOTE: You can design forms using link:{{ '/am/current/am_userguide_user_management_forms.html' | relative_url }}[Custom forms^]. The enrollment form must send the email address using the `email` parameter.

== Recovery Code

The *recovery code* factor generates a set of recovery codes which the user can use to authenticate in case the other options are not available.
The recovery codes are generated and shown only once to the user during the enrollment or login process. It is thus advisable to download and keep the recovery codes in a safe place.

NOTE: The generated recovery codes are alphanumeric and each recovery code can only be used once to ensure greater security.

The image below shows an example recovery code factor configuration.
The configuration is flexible and allows to set the number of recovery codes and the number of digits for each recovery code as per the customer's requirements.

This is an example of what it looks like when the recovery codes are generated during the enrollment process.
The download option allows users to download the recovery codes in pdf format.
