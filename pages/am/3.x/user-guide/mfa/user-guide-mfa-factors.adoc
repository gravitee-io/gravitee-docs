== One-time password

One-Time Password (OTP) allows you to use an Authenticator application via your digital device (mobile phone), such as Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator or Free OTP,
to generate a one-time code which changes over time and will be used as the second factor to validate a user’s account.

If you enable an OTP type factor for your application, next time your users log in they will see the following screens:

== Email verification

With Email verification, you can receive a verification code on your email address to be used as the second factor to validate a user’s account.

Using the `email-am-factor` plugin configuration form, you can define the number of digits used to generate the verification code. The configured resource must be a link:/am/current/am_userguide_resources_smtp.html[SMTP Resource]. The email template used by this plugin is defined in the design section of the domain or application.

*Subject* and *Template* fields use the freemarker syntax to customize the message content. The generated *code* is available using the expression `${code}`. The user profile and the application are accessible using the expressions `${user}` and  `${client}` (ex: `${client.clientName}` will return the application name and `${user.firstName}` will return the first name of the user.)
