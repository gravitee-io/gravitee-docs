== One-time password

One-Time Password (OTP) allows you to use an Authenticator application via your digital device (mobile phone), such as Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator or Free OTP,
to generate a one-time code which changes over time and will be used as the second factor to validate a userâ€™s account.

If you enable an OTP type factor for your application, next time your users log in they will see the following screens:
