== Overview

With Phone call verification, you can receive a verification code via a phone call to be used as the second factor to validate a userâ€™s account.

NOTE: Phone call MFA requires a compatible link:{{ '/am/current/am_userguide_resources.html' | relative_url }}[resource^].

If you enable a *Call* type factor for your application, next time your users log in they will see the following screens:

NOTE: You can change the look and feel of forms using link:{{ '/am/current/am_userguide_user_management_forms.html' | relative_url }}[Custom forms^]. The enrollment form must send the phone number using the `phone` parameter in E.164 notation.
