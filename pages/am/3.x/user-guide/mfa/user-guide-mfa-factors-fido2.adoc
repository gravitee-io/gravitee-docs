== Overview

FIDO2 plugin implements the functionalities so that passwordless authentication flow can be used during the multi-factor authentication process.
This plugin does not have its own configuration rather uses existing *WebAuthn* configuration.

NOTE: Please configure *WebAuthn* under the *Security* section so that the plugin works as expected.
Check the link:{{ '/am/current/am_userguide_passwordless.html' | relative_url }}[Passwordless (W3C WebAuthn)] section for details.

== Enrollment scenarios for FIDO2 factor plugin

The enrollment behavior for the FIDO2 plugin depends on a couple of things.
First, the way the user decides to log on and secondly whether the user already has a passwordless device registered or not.
The plugin considers the following scenarios during enrollment:

. The user provides username and password during the login process and the user does not have a passwordless device registered.
. The user provides username and password during the login process. The user does not have a passwordless device registered and decides to execute the passwordless registration process after log on.
. The user provides username and password during the login process and the user already has the device registered for passwordless login.
. The user selects passwordless login options instead of providing username and password.

== Enrollment step

The following diagram shows how enrollment occurs for the scenarios mentioned in the previous section.
For simplicity the diagram assumes the application has FIDO2 multi-factor enabled.
Notice that this plugin ignores the *MFA  challenge* step during the enrollment process in certain cases.

The following diagram shows only the challenge step.
For simplicity the diagram assumes the user has already enrolled to FID2 factor plugin.
