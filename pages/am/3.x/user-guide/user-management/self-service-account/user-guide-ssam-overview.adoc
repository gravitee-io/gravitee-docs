== Overview

AM self-service account management allows users to manage their accounts with the following capabilities :

- Read and manage their account information.
- List user activities.
- Request to change passwords.
- Manage Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) devices.
- Manage Passwordless credentials.

NOTE: By default these actions are possible only during the login process, but in order to provide a *My Account* space for your end-users, AM includes a REST API to perform all these requests.

You can access the online API reference or the OpenAPI specification :
