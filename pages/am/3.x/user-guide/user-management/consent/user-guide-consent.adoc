== User consent

As described in link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6819#section-5.1.3[RFC 6819^], users should always be in control of authorization
processes and have the necessary information to make informed decisions.

If you want users to acknowledge and accept that they are giving an app access to their data, you can configure AM to display a consent page during the OAuth 2.0/OIDC authentication flow.

NOTE: You can change the look and feel of the user consent form. See link:{{ '/am/current/am_userguide_user_management_forms.html' | relative_url }}[Custom forms^] for more information.

== Revoke user consent

You can view a list of applications for which each user has provided consent.
To revoke access to an application:

. link:{{ '/am/current/am_userguide_authentication.html' | relative_url }}[Log in to AM Console^].
. Click *Settings > Users*.
. Select the user and in the *Authorized Apps* tab, revoke the application.
