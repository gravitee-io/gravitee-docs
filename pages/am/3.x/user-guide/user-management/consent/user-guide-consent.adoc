== User consent

As per as link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6819#section-5.1.3[RFC 6819], the user should always be in control of the authorization
processes and get the necessary information to make informed decisions.

If you want users to acknowledge and accept that they are giving an app access to their data, you can configure Gravitee.io AM to display a consent dialog page during the OAuth 2.0/OIDC authentication flow.

NOTE: Look and feel of the User consent dialog form can be overridden. See link:/am/current/am_userguide_user_management_forms.html[Custom forms] for more information.

== Revoke user consent

For each user, you can see all the applications he has provided consent.
To revoke access to an application :

. Go to http://GRAVITEEIO-AM-UI-HOST
. From the homepage, go to your security domain's settings page and go to `Users` section
. Select the user and go to the `Authorized Apps` tab and revoke the appropriate application.
