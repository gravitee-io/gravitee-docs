== Manage users

=== List users

To search users, navigate to `Users` section of your domain's settings. The input search box will let you find user by its username.

NOTE: Currently only users created by the AM management API or the SCIM protocol and external users who have been already logged can be found.

=== Create user

Users are created for each security domain, to create a user, follow these steps:

. Go to http://GRAVITEEIO-AM-UI-HOST
. From the homepage, go to your security domain's settings page, go to `Users` section and click `(+)` button
. Give your user a *First name*, a *Last name*, an *Email* and an *Username* and press `SAVE`
. Optional : You can also add/modify specific attributes relating to the user. These user metadata will be available in the user's profile.
. You will be redirected to the created user's page

=== User roles

You can assign role directly from the user profile, or from the identity provider role mapping feature.

NOTE: If you are using both user roles and identity provider role mapper feature, both roles will be merged.

NOTE: By default, users are stored in the pre-defined `Default Identity Provider` which is available out of the box for each security domain.
You can apply role mapping with your users.
