== Manage users

=== List users

To search for users, navigate to the *Users* section of your domain's settings and enter the username in the search field.
You can also list users with the `/users` endpoint of AM API.

NOTE: You can only list users created with AM API or the SCIM protocol and external users who have already logged in.

==== List Users with a query (q)

Finds users who match the specified query (Standard search mode).

The value of `q` is matched against `username`, `email`, `displayName`, `firstName` or `lastName`.

NOTE: In AM Portal, you do not need to specify the `q` parameter, only the query value (for example `john doe`).

NOTE: The list operation performs a startsWith match query, you do not need to specify `firstName`, `lastName` or `email` attribute name.

==== List Users with a filter (filter)

Lists all users that match the filter criteria (Advanced search mode).

When searching for users, you can create queries using link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7644#section-3.4.2.2[SCIM 2.0 query syntax] to refine your search.
The search query must contain at least one valid expression with an attribute name followed by an attribute operator and an optional value.

NOTE: Multiple expressions may be combined using the logical operators (`and` / `or`). Operators `[`, `]` and `not` are not supported.

NOTE: In AM Portal, you do not need to specify the `filter` parameter, only the query value (for example `displayName eq "john doe"`).

WARNING: By default only the `id`, `externalId`, `username`, `email`, `displayName`, `firstName` and `lastName` fields are indexed in the database.
This operation also supports searching the `additionalInformation` attributes of your users, but you need to create the correct indexes first.

The following operators are supported :

.Supported operators
[cols="1,1,3"]
|===
|Operator |Description |Behavior

|eq       |equal        | The attribute and operator values must be identical for a match.
|ne       |not equal    | The attribute and operator values are not identical.
|co       |contains     | The entire operator value must be a substring of the attribute value for a match.
|sw       |starts with  | The entire operator value must be a substring of the attribute value, starting at the beginning of the attribute value. This criterion is satisfied if the two strings are identical.
|ew       |ends with    | The entire operator value must be a substring of the attribute value, matching at the end of the attribute value.  This criterion is satisfied if the two strings are identical.
|pr       |present      | If the attribute has a non-empty or non-null value, or if it contains a non-empty node for complex attributes, there is a match.
|gt       |greater than | If the attribute value is greater than the operator value, there is a match. The actual comparison is dependent on the attribute type. For string attribute types, this is a lexicographical comparison, and for DateTime types, it is a chronological comparison.
|ge       |greater than or equal to | If the attribute value is greater than or equal to the operator value, there is a match. The actual comparison is dependent on the attribute type. For string attribute types, this is a lexicographical comparison, and for DateTime types, it is a chronological comparison.
|lt       |less than   | If the attribute value is less than the operator value, there is a match. The actual comparison is dependent on the attribute type. For string attribute types, this is a lexicographical comparison, and for DateTime types, it is a chronological comparison.
|le       |less than or equal to  | If the attribute value is less than or equal to the operator value, there is a match. The actual comparison is dependent on the attribute type. For string attribute types, this is a lexicographical comparison, and for DateTime types, it is a chronological comparison.

The following examples give guidance on how to use this feature. All the attribute names are based on the user model provided by link:/am/current/management-api/index.html[AM API].

----
List disabled users
-> enabled eq false

List users updated after 06/01/2019 but before 01/01/2020
-> updatedAt gt "2019-06-01T00:00:00.000Z" and updatedAt lt "2020-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"

List users by first name
-> firstName co "john"

=== Create user

Users are created for each security domain, to create a user, follow these steps:

. Go to http://GRAVITEEIO-AM-UI-HOST
. From the homepage, go to your security domain's settings page, go to `Users` section and click `(+)` button
. Give your user a *First name*, a *Last name*, an *Email* and an *Username* and press `SAVE`
. Optional : You can also add/modify specific attributes relating to the user. These user metadata will be available in the user's profile.
. You will be redirected to the created user's page

NOTE: You can choose to enable "Pre-Registration", to let the End-user complete his account.
An email will be sent with the corresponding instructions.

image::am/current/graviteeio-am-userguide-um-pre-registration-mail.png[]

=== User roles

You can assign role directly from the user profile, or from the identity provider role mapping feature.

NOTE: If you are using both user roles and identity provider role mapper feature, both roles will be merged.

NOTE: By default, users are stored in the pre-defined `Default Identity Provider` which is available out of the box for each security domain.
You can apply role mapping with your users.
