. link:{{ '/am/current/am_userguide_authentication.html' | relative_url }}[Log in to AM Console^].
. Search for users by clicking *Settings > Users* and entering the username in the search field.

You can also list users with the AM API `/users` endpoint.

NOTE: You can only list users created with AM API or the SCIM protocol and external users who have already logged in.

==== List Users with a query (q)

Finds users who match the specified query (standard search mode).

The value of `q` is matched against `username`, `email`, `displayName`, `firstName` or `lastName`.

NOTE: In AM Console, you do not need to specify the `q` parameter, only the query value (for example `john doe`).

NOTE: The list operation performs a `startsWith` match query; you do not need to specify `firstName`, `lastName` or `email` attribute name.

==== List users with a filter (filter)

Lists all users that match the filter criteria (advanced search mode).

When searching for users, you can create queries using link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7644#section-3.4.2.2[SCIM 2.0 query syntax^] to refine your search.
The search query must contain at least one valid expression with an attribute name followed by an attribute operator and an optional value.

NOTE: Multiple expressions may be combined using the logical operators (`and` / `or`). Operators `[`, `]` and `not` are not supported.

NOTE: In AM Console, you do not need to specify the `filter` parameter, only the query value (for example `displayName eq "john doe"`).

WARNING: By default only the `id`, `externalId`, `username`, `email`, `displayName`, `firstName` and `lastName` fields are indexed in the database.
This operation also supports searching the `additionalInformation` attributes of your users, but you need to create the correct indexes first. If you are using RDBMS backends, please refer to the underlying section `Add new filter fields for RDBMS backends` for more details.

The following operators are supported :

.Supported operators
[cols="1,1,3"]
|===
|Operator |Description |Behavior

|eq       |equal        | The attribute and operator values must be identical for a match.
|ne       |not equal    | The attribute and operator values are not identical.
|co       |contains     | The entire operator value must be a substring of the attribute value for a match.
|sw       |starts with  | The entire operator value must be a substring of the attribute value, starting at the beginning of the attribute value. This criterion is satisfied if the two strings are identical.
|ew       |ends with    | The entire operator value must be a substring of the attribute value, matching at the end of the attribute value.  This criterion is satisfied if the two strings are identical.
|pr       |present      | If the attribute has a non-empty or non-null value, or if it contains a non-empty node for complex attributes, there is a match.
|gt       |greater than | If the attribute value is greater than the operator value, there is a match. The actual comparison is dependent on the attribute type. For string attribute types, this is a lexicographical comparison, and for DateTime types, it is a chronological comparison.
|ge       |greater than or equal to | If the attribute value is greater than or equal to the operator value, there is a match. The actual comparison is dependent on the attribute type. For string attribute types, this is a lexicographical comparison, and for DateTime types, it is a chronological comparison.
|lt       |less than   | If the attribute value is less than the operator value, there is a match. The actual comparison is dependent on the attribute type. For string attribute types, this is a lexicographical comparison, and for DateTime types, it is a chronological comparison.
|le       |less than or equal to  | If the attribute value is less than or equal to the operator value, there is a match. The actual comparison is dependent on the attribute type. For string attribute types, this is a lexicographical comparison, and for DateTime types, it is a chronological comparison.
|===

The following examples give guidance on how to use this feature. All the attribute names are based on the user model provided by link:{{ '/am/current/management-api/index.html' | relative_url }}[AM API^].

----
List disabled users
-> enabled eq false

List users updated after 06/01/2019 but before 01/01/2020
-> updatedAt gt "2019-06-01T00:00:00.000Z" and updatedAt lt "2020-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"

List users by first name
-> firstName co "john"

==== Add new filter field for RDBMS backends

When you are using a RDBMS backend, you will have to execute additional SQL statements to allow searching on `additionalInformation` fields that are not managed by default by AM.

For PostgreSQL, as `additionalInformation` is a JSON field you may have to create additional indexes.

[source, sql]
----
CREATE INDEX idx_users_additional_info_custom ON users USING BTREE (reference_id, reference_type, ((additional_information->>'custom_field')))
----

For MySQL, MariaDB and SQLServer, you will have to create a new column with the value coming from the user `additionalInformation` and create an index.

.MySQL
[source, sql]
----
ALTER TABLE users ADD additional_information_custom VARCHAR(320) AS (JSON_UNQUOTE(additional_information->"$.custom"));
CREATE INDEX idx_users_additional_information_custom ON users(reference_id, reference_type, additional_information_custom);
----

.MariaDB
[source, sql]
----
ALTER TABLE users ADD additional_information_custom VARCHAR(320) AS (JSON_VALUE(additional_information, "$.custom_field"));
CREATE INDEX idx_users_additional_information_custom ON users(reference_id, reference_type, additional_information_custom);
----

.SQLServer
[source, sql]
----
ALTER TABLE users ADD additional_information_custom AS JSON_VALUE(additional_information, '$.custom_field');
CREATE INDEX idx_users_additional_information_custom ON users(reference_id, reference_type, additional_information_custom);
----



=== Create a new user

You create users in a security domain.

. link:{{ '/am/current/am_userguide_authentication.html' | relative_url }}[Log in to AM Console^].
. Click *Settings > Users*.
. Click the plus icon image:{% link images/icons/plus-icon.png %}[role="icon"].
. Give your user a *First name*, a *Last name*, an *Email* and a *Username* and click *SAVE*.
. (Optional) You can also add/modify specific attributes relating to the user. This user metadata will be available in the user's profile.
. You will be redirected to the created user's page.
+
image::{% link images/am/current/graviteeio-am-userguide-um-create-user.png %}[]

NOTE: You can choose to enable `Pre-Registration`, to allow users to finish registering their own account.
An email will be sent to the user with instructions.

image::{% link images/am/current/graviteeio-am-userguide-um-pre-registration-mail.png %}[]

=== User roles

You can assign roles directly from the user profile, or from the identity provider role mapping feature.

NOTE: If you are using both user roles and the identity provider role mapper feature, the two roles will be in two different
places, you can see the different roles in  *Settings > Users > "Your User" > Roles*.

image::{% link images/am/current/graviteeio-am-userguide-um-user-assigned-dynamic-roles.png %}[]

NOTE: By default, users are stored in the pre-defined `Default Identity Provider`, which is available by default for each security domain.
You can apply role mapping to your users.
