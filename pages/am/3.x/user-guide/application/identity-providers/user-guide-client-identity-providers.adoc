== Overview

AM allows your application to use different identity providers. If you haven't configured your providers yet,
visit the link:{{ '/am/current/am_userguide_create_identity_provider.html' | relative_url }}[Identity Provider^] guide.

The application identity providers are separated into two sections:

- The regular Identity Providers (called also *internal*) that operate inside and AM without redirecting to another provider
- The Social/Enterprise Identity Providers that require an external service to perform authentication (usually via SSO)

You can enable/disable them to include them within your authentication flow.

== Priority

[label label-version]#New in version 3.17#

Identity provider priority enables processing authentication in a certain order. It gives more control over the authentication flow by deciding which provider should evaluate credentials
first.

In order to change the priority of the providers:

 - Make sure your provider is *selected*
 - Simply *drag-and-drop* the providers
 - Save your settings

== Selection rules

[label label-version]#New in version 3.17#

Identity provider selection rules also give you more control over the authentication via link:{{ '/am/current/am_userguide_expression_language.html' | relative_url }}[Expression Language^]

When coupled with link:{{ '/am/current/am_userguide_policies_extension_points.html' | relative_url }}[Flows^] you can decide which provider will be used to authenticate your end users.

To apply a selection rule:

- Click on the *Selection rule* icon
- Enter your expression language rule
- Validate and save your settings

When applying rules on *regular* Identity Providers:

- If the rule is empty, the provider *will be* taken into account (this is to be retro-compatible when migrating from a previous version)
- Otherwise, AM will authenticate with the first identity provider where the rule matches.

If you are not using link:{{ 'am/current/am_userguide_login_identifier_first_login_flow.html' | relative_url }}[Identifier First Login] the rule won't
be effective on Social/Enterprise providers

However, if you are using Identifier First Login:

- If the rule is empty, the provider *WILL NOT BE* taken into account (this is to be retro-compatible when migrating from a previous version)
- Otherwise, AM will authenticate with the first identity provider where the rule matches.
