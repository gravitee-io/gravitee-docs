After you have created the new application, you will be redirected to the application's `Overview` page that contains some documentation and code samples to help you start with the application configuration.

== Test the application

The fastest way to test your fresh created client is to request for an OAuth2 access token by following the link:/am_quickstart_register_app.html[Register your first application] tutorial.
If you succeed to get an access token, your client is all set.
