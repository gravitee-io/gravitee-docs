NOTE: New in Gravitee.io AM 3.2.x

Gravitee.io AM provides support for link:https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/[W3C Web Authentication (WebAuthn)] letting users to authenticate to their account without a password.

NOTE: WebAuthn is supported in the Chrome, Firefox, and Edge browsers to different degrees, but support for credential creation and assertion using a U2F Token, like those provided by Yubico and Feitian, is supported by all of them.
For more information please have a look to link:https://webauthn.io/[WebAuthn.io]

WARNING: Please note that this is the first version for WebAuthn support and Relying Party (RP) conformance tests are pretty new for the time being. This support’s specification and user interfaces may change.

To enable Passwordless, select your web application in the Gravitee.io AM portal and go to your `Settings > Login` section and enable `Passwordless` option.

== Authenticate with WebAuthn

=== Registration

If your application enabled `Passwordless`, end-users need first, to register their security devices (known as link:https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/#usecase-new-device-registration[Authenticators]).

Users have to login with their username/password in a traditional way and they will see the following screen :

image::am/current/graviteeio-am-userguide-passwordless-enroll.png[Passwordless Registration]

NOTE: After registration process, users will be redirected to your application and their authenticators are now registered.

=== Login

NOTE: Make sure your users have link:/am/current/am_userguide_passwordless.html#registration[registered their security devices].

If your application enabled `Passwordless` a new link `Sign in with fingerprint, device or security key` will be displayed in the Login Page.

image::am/current/graviteeio-am-userguide-passwordless-login-page.png[Login page]

By clicking on the link, the user will be redirected to the "Passwordless Login Page". The user has to enter its username and press `Sign in`. A security window will pop up, follow the instructions to sign in.

NOTE: Look and feel of the Passwordless forms can be overridden. See link:/am/current/am_userguide_user_management_forms.html[Custom forms] for more information.

== Managing WebAuthn

=== Managing Authenticators

WebAuthn authenticators are listed in the `Users -> User -> Credentials` section of your users in the Gravitee.io AM portal. You can review and remove these credentials at any time.

=== Managing Global Settings

Administrators of your security domain can manage the WebAuthn settings under `Settings -> WebAuthn` section.

The configurable options and their description follow.

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Name |Description

| Origin
| This value needs to match `window.location.origin` evaluated by the User Agent during registration and authentication ceremonies.

| Relying party name
| Relying Party name for display purposes.

| Require resident key
| This member describes the Relying Party's requirements regarding resident credentials. If the parameter is set to true, the authenticator MUST create a client-side-resident public key credential source when creating a public key credential.

| User verification
| This member describes the Relying Party's requirements regarding user verification. User verification serves to ensure that the persons authenticating to a service is in fact who they say they are for the purposes of that service.

| Authenticator Attachment
| Mechanism used by clients to communicate with authenticators;

- `unspecified` value means that the web browser will display all possibilities (both native devices and cross platform devices such as security key),

- `platform` value means only platform native devices will be displayed (ex: TouchID on MacOSX)

- `cross-platform` value means only devices able to work on all platforms will be displayed (ex: security keys such as Yubikey).

| Attestation Conveyance Preference
| WebAuthn Relying Parties may use AttestationConveyancePreference to specify their preference regarding attestation conveyance during credential generation.

- `none` This value indicates that the Relying Party is not interested in authenticator attestation.
For example, in order to potentially avoid having to obtain user consent to relay identifying information to the Relying Party, or to save a roundtrip to an Attestation CA.

This is the default value.

- `indirect` This value indicates that the Relying Party prefers an attestation conveyance yielding verifiable attestation statements, but allows the client to decide how to obtain such attestation statements.
The client MAY replace the authenticator-generated attestation statements with attestation statements generated by an Anonymization CA, in order to protect the user’s privacy, or to assist Relying Parties with attestation verification in a heterogeneous ecosystem.

Note: There is no guarantee that the Relying Party will obtain a verifiable attestation statement in this case. For example, in the case that the authenticator employs self attestation.

- `direct` This value indicates that the Relying Party wants to receive the attestation statement as generated by the authenticator.

== Future evolutions

As you noticed, this is a first implementation of passwordless support.
We have lot of ideas to improve users experience, among which:

* allow user to use his webauthn device instead of defining a password during registration.
* automatically detect webauthn devices and remove the step where user must provide his username before he can use his webauthn device.
* allow user to manage their device credentials (add, revoke, ...).
* ...
