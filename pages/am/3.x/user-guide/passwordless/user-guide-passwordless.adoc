NOTE: New in Gravitee.io AM 3.2.x

Gravitee.io AM provides support for link:https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/[W3C Web Authentication (WebAuthn)] letting users to authenticate to their account without a password.

NOTE: WebAuthn is supported in the Chrome, Firefox, and Edge browsers to different degrees, but support for credential creation and assertion using a U2F Token, like those provided by Yubico and Feitian, is supported by all of them.
For more information please have a look to link:https://webauthn.io/[WebAuthn.io]

WARNING: Please note that this is the first version for WebAuthn support and Relying Party (RP) conformance tests are pretty new for the time being. This supportâ€™s specification and user interfaces may change.

To enable Passwordless, select your web application in the Gravitee.io AM portal and go to your `Settings > Login` section and enable `Passwordless` option.

== Authenticate with WebAuthn

=== Registration

If your application enabled `Passwordless`, end-users need first, to register their security devices (known as link:https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/#usecase-new-device-registration[Authenticators]).

Users have to login with their username/password in a traditional way and they will see the following screen :

NOTE: After registration process, users will be redirected to your application and their authenticators are now registered.

=== Login

NOTE: Make sure your users have link:/am/current/am_userguide_passwordless.html#registration[registered their security devices].

If your application enabled `Passwordless` a new link `Sign in with fingerprint, device or security key` will be displayed in the Login Page.

image::am/current/graviteeio-am-userguide-passwordless-login-page.png[Login page]

By clicking on the link, the user will be redirected to the "Passwordless Login Page". The user has to enter its username and press `Sign in`. A security window will pop up, follow the instructions to sign in.

WebAuthn authenticators are listed in the `Users -> User -> Credentials` section of your users in the Gravitee.io AM portal. You can review and remove these credentials at any time.

=== Managing Global Settings

Administrators of your security domain can manage the WebAuthn settings under `Settings -> WebAuthn` section.

The configurable options and their description follow.

|Name |Description

| Origin
| This value needs to match `window.location.origin` evaluated by the User Agent during registration and authentication ceremonies.

| Relying party name
| Relying Party name for display purposes.

| Require resident key
| This member describes the Relying Party's requirements regarding resident credentials. If the parameter is set to true, the authenticator MUST create a client-side-resident public key credential source when creating a public key credential.

| User verification
| This member describes the Relying Party's requirements regarding user verification. User verification serves to ensure that the persons authenticating to a service is in fact who they say they are for the purposes of that service.

| Authenticator Attachment
a| Mechanism used by clients to communicate with authenticators;

* `unspecified` value means that the web browser will display all possibilities (both native devices and cross platform devices such as security key),
* `platform` value means only platform native devices will be displayed (ex: TouchID on MacOSX)
* `cross-platform` value means only devices able to work on all platforms will be displayed (ex: security keys such as Yubikey).

== Future evolutions

As you noticed, this is a first implementation of passwordless support.
We have lot of ideas to improve users experience, among which:

* allow user to use his webauthn device instead of defining a password during registration.
* automatically detect webauthn devices and remove the step where user must provide his username before he can use his webauthn device.
* allow user to manage their device credentials (add, revoke, ...).
* ...
