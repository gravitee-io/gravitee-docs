NOTE: Since version 3.10.0, it is possible to add new flows and apply condition execution on each flow using Expression Language. If multiple flows have a valid condition (or have an empty one), all these flows are executed.

== All flow

The *ALL* flow is executed on each incoming request for one of the login, consent or register flows.

== Login flow

The *LOGIN* flow allows you to fetch more information or validate incoming data during the End-User authentication phase.

=== Pre Login

The Pre step allows you to fetch more information before displaying the Login HTML Page.

The following attributes are available while processing the policy chain:

* link:{{ '/am/current/am_userguide_policies_extension_points.html#request' | relative_url }}[Request]: current HTTP Request
* link:{{ '/am/current/am_userguide_policies_extension_points.html#client' | relative_url }}[Client]: the application

=== Post Login

Post End-User Consent happens after the user has given his consent to the processing of personal data. It allows you to validate incoming data (user consent) before giving access to the application.
