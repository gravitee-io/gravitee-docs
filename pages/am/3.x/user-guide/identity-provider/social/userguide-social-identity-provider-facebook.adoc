== Overview

You can authenticate users with Facebook. Before you begin, you need to sign up for a link:https://www.facebook.com/r.php?next=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.facebook.com%2F&locale=en_US&display=page[Facebook Developer account].

== Steps

To connect your application to Facebook, you will:

- Register a new application in Facebook
- Create a Facebook identity provider in AM
- Set up the connection in Facebook
- Test the connection

== Register a new application in Facebook

. link:https://developers.facebook.com/apps/[Add a New App] from the Facebook for Developers Portal.
. For *How are you using your app?*, select *For everything else*.
. Give your application a name.
. Click *Create*.

NOTE: Facebook will generate an App ID and App Secret for your application. Make a note of these for later use.

== Create a Facebook identity provider

. link:/am/current/am_userguide_authentication.html[Log in to AM Console^].

Go to your Facebook application settings and add *Facebook Login* to the application as a Product.

Configure the following settings:

. Enable *Client OAuth Login*.
. Enable *Web OAuth Login*
. Add a *Valid OAuth Redirect URIs* with the Redirect URI created in the previous step.
. Click *Save Changes*.

You can test your Facebook connection using a web application created in AM.

If the button is not visible, there may be a problem with the identity provider settings. Check the AM Gateway log for more information.
