== Overview

You can authenticate users with Azure Active Directory. Before you begin, you need to sign up for a link:https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=visualstudio[Azure account] and link:https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=visualstudio[Set up a tenant].

== Steps

To connect your application to Azure AD, you will:

- Register a new application in Azure AD
- Create a Azure AD identity provider in Gravitee.io AM
- Set up the connection in Azure AD
- Test the connection

== Register a new application in Azure AD

link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app[Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform].

. Sign in to the link:https://portal.azure.com/[Azure portal^].
. If you have access to multiple tenants, use the *Directory + subscription* filter in the top menu to select the tenant for which you want to register an application.
. Search for and select Azure Active Directory.
. Under *Manage*, select *App registrations*, then *New registration*.
. Enter a Name for your application.
. Specify who can use the application.
. Do not enter anything for *Redirect URI* at this point, you will be able to configure one in the next section (note that this field is optional).
. Click *Register* to complete the initial app registration.
+
NOTE: Azure will generate an Application ID. We need to create a new client secret.
+
. Select your application in *App registrations* in the Azure portal.
. Select *Certificates & secrets > New client secret*.
. Add a description for your client secret.
. Select a duration.
. Click *Add*.
+
NOTE: Record the client secret value for later use, as it is not displayed again after you leave this page.

== Create an Azure AD identity provider

. link:/am/current/am_userguide_authentication.html[Log in to AM Console^].
. If you want to change to a different security domain, select it from the user menu at the top right.
. Click the plus icon image:icons/plus-icon.png[].
. Choose the *Azure AD* identity provider type and click *Next*.
+
NOTE: Ensure you have the generated Client ID and Client Secret from the Azure AD application to hand.
+

+

+
. Enter your Azure application ID and Client Secret.
+

NOTE: On the right of the screen, under `1. Configure the Redirect URI`, copy the value of the URL. You will need to update it in your Azure AD application settings.

== Set up the connection

. Go to your Azure AD application settings and click *Add a Redirect URI* from your application overview page.
. Enter the value of the Redirect URI created in the previous step and click *Save*.

== Test the connection

You can test the Azure AD connection using a web application created in AM.

. In AM Console, click *Applications* and select your social identity provider.
