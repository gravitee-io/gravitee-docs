== Overview

You can authenticate users in AM with GitHub. Before you begin, you need to sign up for a link:https://github.com/join[GitHub Developer account].

== Steps

To connect your application to GitHub, you will:

- Register a new application in GitHub
- Create a GitHub identity provider in Gravitee.io AM
- Set up the connection in GitHub
- Test the connection

== Register a new application in GitHub

. link:https://github.com/settings/applications/new[Register a new OAuth application] from *GitHub Developer Settings: OAuth Apps*.
. Give your application a name.
. For *Homepage URL* enter `https://AM_HOST/SECURITY_DOMAIN`.
. For *Authorization callback URL* enter `https://AM_HOST/SECURITY_DOMAIN/login/callback`
. Click *Register application*.

NOTE: GitHub will generate a Client ID and Client Secret for your application. Make a note of these for later use.

NOTE: The `Authorization callback URL` is a temporary value that will be updated when you link:{{ '/am/current/am_userguide_social_identity_provider_github.html#set_up_the_connection' | relative_url }}[Set up the connection].

== Create a GitHub identity provider

. link:{{ '/am/current/am_userguide_authentication.html' | relative_url }}[Log in to AM Console^].
. Click *Settings > Providers*.
. Click the plus icon image:{% link images/icons/plus-icon.png %}[role="icon"].
. Choose the *GitHub* identity provider type and click *Next*.

NOTE: On the right side of the screen, under *1. Configure the Redirect URI* copy the value of the URL. You will use it to update your GitHub application settings.

== Set up the connection

. Go to your GitHub OAuth application settings.
. Update the *Authorization callback URL* value with the Redirect URI created in the previous step.

== Test the connection

You can test your GitHub connection using a web application created in AM.

. In AM Console, click *Applications* and select your social identity provider.
+
image::{% link images/am/current/graviteeio-am-userguide-social-idp-list.png %}[]
+
. Call the Login Page (i.e the `/oauth/authorize` endpoint). If the connection is working you will see a *Sign in with ...* button.
+

If the button is not visible, something may be wrong with the identity provider settings. Check the AM Gateway log for more information.
