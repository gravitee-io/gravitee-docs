== Overview

You can authenticate users in AM with GitHub. Before you begin, you need to sign up for a link:https://github.com/join[GitHub Developer account].

== Steps

To connect your application to GitHub, you will:

- Register a new application in GitHub
- Create a GitHub identity provider in Gravitee.io AM
- Set up the connection in GitHub
- Test the connection

== Register a new application in GitHub

. link:https://github.com/settings/applications/new[Register a new OAuth application] from *GitHub Developer Settings: OAuth Apps*.
. Give your application a name.
. For *Homepage URL* enter `https://AM_HOST/SECURITY_DOMAIN`.
. For *Authorization callback URL* enter `https://AM_HOST/SECURITY_DOMAIN/login/callback`
. Click *Register application*.

NOTE: GitHub will generate a Client ID and Client Secret for your application. Make a note of these for later use.

NOTE: The `Authorization callback URL` is a temporary value that will be updated when you link:/am/current/am_userguide_social_identity_provider_github.html#set_up_the_connection[Set up the connection].

== Create a GitHub identity provider

. link:/am/current/am_userguide_authentication.html[Log in to AM Console^].

== Set up the connection

If the button is not visible, something may be wrong with the identity provider settings. Check the AM Gateway log for more information.
