== Overview

You can authenticate users in AM with LinkedIn. Before you begin, you need to sign up for a link:https://www.linkedin.com/developers[LinkedIn Developer account].

To connect your application to LinkedIn, you will:

- Register a new application in LinkedIn
- Create a LinkedIn identity provider in AM
- Set up the connection in LinkedIn
- Test the connection

== Register a new application in LinkedIn

Go to link:https://www.linkedin.com/developers[Create app] in the LinkedIn Developer Portal.

. Give your application a name, a LinkedIn page and a logo.
. Click *Create app*.

NOTE: LinkedIn will generate a Client ID and Client Secret for your application. Make a note of them for later use.

== Create a LinkedIn identity provider
