You can authenticate and manage users in AM using remote API calls.

WARNING: For the Identity Provider to work, the user's payload must at least contain the following claims : _sub_.
To obtain more information about your user you can use the link: link:https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#StandardClaims[Standard Claims] of the OpenID Connect protocol.
You can achieve this with the AM User Mapper feature.

== Create an HTTP identity provider

You create one identify provider for each security domain.

To create an identity provider:

. Go to http://GRAVITEEIO-AM-UI-HOST.
. Click *Settings > Providers*.
. Click the *+* button.
. Select *HTTP* as your identity provider type and click *NEXT*.
. Give your identity provider a name.
. Configure the settings as requested.
. Click *Create*.

=== Configuration

The HTTP Identity Provider is used to invoke an HTTP(S) URL and store the response content in one or more variables of the execution context.

The result of the authentication is stored in a variable named `authenticationResponse` and the User Management operations are stored in the _usersResponse_ variable.

These variables can be used to check whether the API calls have failed. The sections below list the data context and options you can configure for your identity provider.

== Test connection

You can test your http connection via your web applications created in AM.

In AM Portal, navigate to your *Application > Identity Providers* section and select your HTTP identity provider.

To complete your tests, call the Login page (i.e `/oauth/authorize` endpoint) and try to sign in with the username/password form.

NOTE: If you are unable to authenticate your users, there may be a problem with the identity provider settings. Check the AM Gateway log and audit logs for more information.
