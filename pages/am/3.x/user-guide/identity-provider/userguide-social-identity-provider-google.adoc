== Steps

To connect your application to Google, you will:

- Register a new application in Google
- Create a Google identity provider in AM
- Set up the connection in Google
- Test the connection

== Register a new application in Google

link:https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials[Create your client credentials] from Google Developer Console using the link:https://support.google.com/googleapi/answer/6158849[Setting up OAuth 2.0] documentation.

NOTE: Google will generate a Client ID and Client Secret for your application; make a note of these for later use.

== Create a Google identity provider

You create an identity provider for each security domain.

To create an identity provider:

. Go to http://GRAVITEEIO-AM-UI-HOST.
. Click *Settings > Providers*.
. Click the *+* button.
. Select *Google* as your identity provider type and click *NEXT*.

NOTE: Ensure you have the Client ID and Client Secret generated by Google to hand.

[start=5]
. Give your identity provider a name.
. Enter your Google Client ID and Client Secret.
. Click *Create*.

NOTE: Copy the URL in *1. Configure the Redirect URI* to the right of the page. You need this value to update your Google application settings in the next section.

== Set up the connection

Go to your Google OAuth 2.0 Client settings and edit the *Authorized redirect URIs*.

. Add a *Authorized redirect URI* with the Redirect URI created in the previous step.
. Click *Save*.

== Test the connection

You can test your Google connection using the web applications you created in AM.

In AM Portal, click *Application > Identity Providers* and select your social identity provider.

To test the connection, call the Login page (the `/oauth/authorize` endpoint). If your connection is successful, you will see a *Sign in with* button.

NOTE: If you do not see the button, there may be a problem with the identity provider settings. Check the AM Gateway log for more information.
