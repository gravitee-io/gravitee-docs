== Overview

You can bind some identity provider attributes to an AM _user profile_ with attribute mapping. Using this method, AM clients can receive additional attributes through your identity provider.

TIP: We advise you to read link:/am/current/am_quickstart_profile_information.html[Get user profile information^] first.

_User profile_ attributes can be retrieved either by calling the _UserInfo_ endpoint or, if you specify an `openid` scope for your application, by parsing the claims in the `id_token`.

== User mappers

In the identity providers *User mappers* tab, you can add mappings between user attributes to be returned by the identity provider, with custom attributes that will be stored within the _User Profile_.

With an LDAP identity provider, if you don't define any mappings, the following attributes are returned by default:

[width="50%",cols="6,4"]
|===
|LDAP attribute |OIDC attribute

|displayname |name
|givenname|given_name
|sn|family_name
|mail|email
|the username typed in the login form|preferred_username
|===

The user name is also the attribute used to look up the user in LDAP, as defined per the default pattern: `uid={0}`

WARNING: Once you start using the *User Mapper* feature, the default claims listed above will no longer appear in the _User Profile_. Instead, only the declared mappings will apply. +
The same applies when the client starts using scopes other than `openid`.

=== Example

Let's imagine a client application wants to retrieve the `telephoneNumber` attribute present in the LDAP identity provider. You can do this by configuring the identity provider as follows:

. link:/am/current/am_userguide_authentication.html[Log in to AM Console^].
+
TIP: If you want to update your identity provider in a different security domain, select the domain from the user menu.
+
. Click *Settings > Providers*.
. Select your LDAP identity provider and click the *User mappers* tab.
. Map your LDAP (raw) attribute `telephoneNumber` to a new user attribute named `telephone_number`:
+

+
. Get the _User Profile_ information via the link::\am\current\UserInfo Endpoint[UserInfo Endpoint] and you will see that the new user attribute is present.
+
[source,bash,subs="verbatim"]
----
curl -X GET http://GRAVITEEIO-AM-GATEWAY-HOST/:securityDomainPath/oidc/userinfo -H 'Authorization: Bearer :accessToken'
----
+
If it is working correctly, you will see the something like this:
+
[source]
----
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, max-age=0, must-revalidate
Pragma: no-cache
{
    "uid": "johndoe",
    "given_name": "John",
    "family_name": "Doe"
    "telephone_number: "202-555-0105"
}
----

The same principle applies for any identity provider.

=== A few words about OIDC scopes and claims

According to the https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ScopeClaims[OpenID Connect core specification^], using scopes such as `profile`, `phone`, `email` or `address` will retrieve sets of specific claims. +
For example, using the `profile` scope will return the following claims, if available: `name`, `family_name`, `given_name`, `middle_name`, `nickname`, `preferred_username`, `profile`, `picture`, `website`, `gender`, `birthdate`, `zoneinfo`, `locale`, and `updated_at`. +
You can see their https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#StandardClaims[definitions here^].

== Role mapper and dynamic OAuth2 scopes

AM allows you to create roles and permissions for your users. You can map these roles to your identity provider user attributes or groups. +

Defining roles in AM helps you to centralize Access Management for all clients in a given _domain_.

In addition, when it comes to fine grained authorization management, it is considered good practice to use OAuth _scopes_.

The goal is to dynamically add scopes to the `access_token`, depending on the role associated with the user when authenticating.

=== Example

In the following example, we will map a role named `administrator` to users who are members of the `IT_DEVELOPERS_TEAM` LDAP group. +
We will then dynamically add the `admin` scope to the `access_token`.
The client will provide this scope when accessing an API via an API Manager, and the API Manager will check for the scope before granting access to the upstream API.

. link:/am/current/am_userguide_authentication.html[Log in to AM Console^].
. Click *Settings > Scopes*.
. Click the plus icon image:icons\plus-icon.png[] and create an `admin` scope.
. Click *Settings > Roles*.
. Click the plus icon image:icons\plus-icon.png[] and create an `administrator` role. Select the `admin` scope permission.
. Go to the `Providers` section
. Click *Settings > Providers* and select your LDAP identity provider.
. Click the *Role mappers* tab.
. Set the user's role configuration:
+
image::am/current/graviteeio-am-userguide-idp-role-mappers.png[]
+
. When the client requests the _Token_ endpoint, the new scope representing the user roles will be used.
+
NOTE: Ensure you enable the _"Enhance scopes"_ option for your client (*OAuth* tab).

The same principle applies for all identity providers.
