== Set up the connection

Go to your GitHub OAuth application settings and update `Authorization callback URL` value with the Redirect URI created in the previous step.

To properly test, you should call the Login Page (i.e `/oauth/authorize` endpoint) and should see the `Sign in with ...` button.

NOTE: If the social button is not here, it means that something is invalid with the identity provider settings. Check the Gravitee.io AM gateway log for more information.
