== Overview

Inline identity providers are based on in-memory user directories. They are useful for testing purposes or setting default accounts.

== Create an inline identity provider

You create one identify provider for each security domain.

To create an identity provider:

. Go to http://GRAVITEEIO-AM-UI-HOST.
. Click *Settings > Providers*.
. Click the *+* button.
. Select *Inline* as your identity provider type and click *NEXT*.
. Give your identity provider a name.
. Configure the settings as requested.
. Click *Create*.

NOTE: If you want to register multiple users, click the *Add user* button before clicking on the *Create* button.

You can also create the identity provider with link:/am/current/management-api/index.html[AM API].

== Test connection

You can test your database connection via your web applications created in AM.

In AM Portal, navigate to your *Application > Identity Providers* section and select your inline identity provider.

To complete your tests, call the Login page (i.e `/oauth/authorize` endpoint) and try to sign in with the username/password form.

NOTE: If you are unable to authenticate your users, there may be a problem with the identity provider settings. Check the AM Gateway log and audit logs for more information.
