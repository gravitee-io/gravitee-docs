== Overview

You can authenticate and manage users in AM using remote API calls.

WARNING: For the Identity Provider to work, the user's payload must at least contain the following claims: `_sub_`.
To obtain more information about your user you can use the link: link:https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#StandardClaims[Standard Claims] of the OpenID Connect protocol.
You can achieve this with the AM User Mapper feature.

== Create an HTTP identity provider

. link:{{ '/am/current/am_userguide_authentication.html' | relative_url }}[Log in to AM Console^].
. Click *Settings > Providers*.
. Click the plus icon image:{% link images/icons/plus-icon.png %}[role="icon"].
. Select *HTTP* as your identity provider type and click *Next*.
. Give your identity provider a name.
. Configure the settings.
. Click *Create*.

=== Configuration

The HTTP Identity Provider is used to invoke an HTTP(S) URL and store the response content in one or more variables of the execution context.

The result of the authentication is stored in a variable named `authenticationResponse` and the User Management operations are stored in the `_usersResponse_` variable.

These variables can be used to check whether the API calls have failed. The sections below list the data context and options you can configure for your identity provider.

[label label-version]#New in 3.17.2# 

NOTE: In previous versions the link:{{ '/am/current/am_userguide_identity_provider_mapping.html#user_mappers' | relative_url }}[User Mapper^] wasn't applied on User resource responses, since the version 3.17.2, a new checkbox has been introduced to apply User Mapper on User resource responses.

== Test the connection

You can test your http connection using a web application created in AM.

. In AM Console, click *Applications* and select your HTTP identity provider.
+
image::{% link images/am/current/graviteeio-am-userguide-social-idp-list.png %}[]
+
. Call the Login page (i.e `/oauth/authorize` endpoint) and try to sign in with the username/password form.
+
If you are unable to authenticate your user, there may be a problem with the identity provider settings. Check the AM Gateway log and audit logs for more information.
