== Overview

The CAS protocol is a simple and powerful ticket-based protocol.

It involves one or many clients and one server. Clients are embedded in CASified applications (called "CAS services") and the CAS server is a standalone component:

- The CAS server is responsible for authenticating users and granting accesses to applications.
- The CAS clients protect the CAS applications and retrieve the identity of the granted users from the CAS server.

The key concepts are:

* *TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket)*: the TGT is stored in the TGC cookie and represents a SSO session for a user.
* *ST (Service Ticket)*: the ST is transmitted as a GET parameter in a URL. It stands for the access granted by the CAS server to the CASified application for a specific user.

CAS specifies a Browser Single-Signon sequence diagram involving a CAS server, an application (CAS Service) and a principal wielding an HTTP user agent (a browser)
which is used by AM to create a bridge between your applications and a CAS Server.

NOTE: In this scenario the AM CAS identity provider acts as a CAS service between your application and the CAS server.

== Get your CAS Server metadata

To connect your applications to a CAS, you need at least the following information:

- *Login URL*: location of the CAS server login URL
- *Service Validate URL*: CAS service validate URL

NOTE: Before you begin, obtain this information from your CAS server administrator and make a note of it for later use.

== Create a CAS connector

. link:{{ '/am/current/am_userguide_authentication.html' | relative_url }}[Log in to AM Console^].
. Click *Settings > Providers*.
. Click the plus icon image:{% link images/icons/plus-icon.png %}[role="icon"].
. Select *CAS* as your identity provider type and click *Next*.
. Give your identity provider a name.
. Configure the settings (Login URL, Service Validate URL)
. Click *Create*.

NOTE: Make a note of the URL in *1. Configure the Redirect URI* to the right of the page. This is the CAS service URL you need to provide to the CAS server to register your Access Management instance.

== Test the connection

You can test your CAS connection using a web application created in AM.

. In AM Console, click *Applications > App > Identity Providers* and select your CAS connector.

+
. Call the Login page (the `/oauth/authorize` endpoint). If the connection is working you will see a *Sign in with CAS* button.
+
If the button is not visible, there may be a problem with the identity provider settings. Check the AM Gateway log for more information.

. Click *Sign in with CAS*. You will be redirected your CAS Server login page to authenticate your users.
+
If your user is already connected (SSO session), the user will be automatically redirected to your application with an OAuth 2.0 access token and Open ID Connect ID token, if requested.
