== Steps

To connect your application to Azure AD, you will:

- Register a new application in Azure AD
- Create a Azure AD identity provider in Gravitee.io AM
- Set up the connection in Azure AD
- Test connection

== Register a new application in Azure AD

link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app[Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform].

. Sign in to the link:https://portal.azure.com/[Azure portal]
. If you have access to multiple tenants, use the Directory + subscription filter in the top menu to select the tenant in which you want to register an application.
. Search for and select Azure Active Directory
. Under `Manage`, select `App registrations`, then `New registration`
. Enter a Name for your application
. Specify who can use the application
. Don't enter anything for Redirect URI (optional), you'll configure one in the next section.
. Press `Register` to complete the initial app registration.

NOTE: Azure will generate an Application ID, we need to create a new client secret.

[start=9]
. Select your application in App registrations in the Azure portal.
. Select `Certificates & secrets > New client secret`
. Add a description for your client secret
. Select a duration
. Select Add

NOTE: Record the secret's value for later use, it's never displayed again after you leave this page.

== Create a Azure AD identity provider

Identity providers are created for each security domain, to create an identity provider, follow these steps:

. Go to http://GRAVITEEIO-AM-UI-HOST
. From the homepage, go to your security domain's `Settings` page, go to `Providers` section
. From the security domain's providers page, click `(+)` button
. Choose the Azure AD identity provider and press `NEXT`

NOTE: Make sure to grab the generated Client ID and Client Secret from Azure AD application.

[start=5]
. Give your identity provider a name
. Set your Azure Tenant ID of your application
. Copy/paste your Azure application Application ID and Client Secret
. Press `Create`

NOTE: On the right side of the screen, under `1. Configure the Redirect URI` copy the value of the URL, it will be used to update your Azure AD application settings.

== Set up the connection

Go to your Azure AD application settings and `Add a Redirect URI` from the Overview page of your application. Enter the value of the Redirect URI created in the previous step and press `Save`.

== Test connection

You can test Azure AD connection via your web applications created in Gravitee.io AM.

In the Portal UI, navigate to your `Application > Identity Providers` section and select your social identity provider.

To properly test, you should call the Login Page (i.e `/oauth/authorize` endpoint) and should see the `Sign in with ...` button.

NOTE: If the social button is not here, it means that something is invalid with the identity provider settings. Check the Gravitee.io AM gateway log for more information.
