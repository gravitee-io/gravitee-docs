== Overview

This section gives a general overview of creating identity providers. For more details of connecting your applications with specific identity provider types, see the following sections:

- link:/am/current/am_userguide_enterprise_identity_providers.html[Enterprise identity providers]
- link:/am/current/am_userguide_social_identity_providers.html[Social identity providers]
- link:/am/current/am_userguide_database_identity_providers.html[Database identity providers]

== Create a new identity provider

In this example, we are creating an inline identity provider.

TIP: If you want to create your identity provider in a different security domain, select the domain from the user menu.

. Click *Settings > Providers*.
. In the Identity Providers page, click the plus icon image:icons/plus-icon.png[].
. Choose an *Inline* identity provider type and click *Next*.

== Custom identity provider

AM is designed to be extended based on a pluggable module architecture.
You can develop your own identity provider using a _plugin_, and provide an authentication method to register your users so they can use AM.

== Test an identity provider

The fastest way to test your newly created identity provider is to request an OAuth2 access token, as described in link:/am/current/am_quickstart_profile_information.html#id-token[ID Token^].
If you successfully retrieve an access token, your identity provider is all set.
