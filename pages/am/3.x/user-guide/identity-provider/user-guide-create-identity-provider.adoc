Gravitee.io Access Management is a flexible and extensible solution based on pluggable modules architecture.
You can develop your own identity provider and provide an authenticate method to register your users to use them with Gravitee.io AM.

== Testing identity provider

The fastest way to test your fresh created identity provider is to request for an OAuth2 access token by following the link:/am/current/am_quickstart_authenticate_users.html[Authenticate users with Identity Provider] tutorial.
If you succeed to get an access token, your identity provider is all set.
