. Give your identity provider a *Name*.

== Custom identity provider

image::{% link images/am/current/graviteeio-am-userguide-custom-idp.png %}[]

AM is designed to be extended based on a pluggable module architecture.
You can develop your own identity provider using a _plugin_, and provide an authentication method to register your users so they can use AM.

== Test an identity provider

The fastest way to test your newly created identity provider is to request an OAuth2 access token, as described in link:{{ '/am/current/am_quickstart_profile_information.html#id-token' | relative_url }}[ID Token^].
If you successfully retrieve an access token, your identity provider is all set.
