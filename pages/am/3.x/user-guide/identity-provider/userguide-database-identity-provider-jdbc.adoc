NOTE: New in Gravitee.io AM 3.3.x

NOTE: Make sure that your database has the appropriate fields to store user profiles attributes, such as `id`, `username`, `email`, `password` and `metadata`.

You can authenticate users with the most common databases in AM, including:

- PostgreSQL
- MySQL
- Microsoft SQL Server
- MariaDB

== Create a SQL database identity provider

You create one identify provider for each security domain.

To create an identity provider:

. Go to http://GRAVITEEIO-AM-UI-HOST.
. Click *Settings > Providers*.
. Click the *+* button.
. Select *JDBC* as your identity provider type and click *NEXT*.
. Give your identity provider a name.
. Configure the settings as requested.
. Click *Create*.

== Test connection

You can test your database connection via your web applications created in AM.

In AM Portal, navigate to your *Application > Identity Providers* section and select your JDBC identity provider.

To complete your tests, call the Login page (i.e `/oauth/authorize` endpoint) and try to sign in with the username/password form.

NOTE: If you are unable to authenticate your users, there may be a problem with the identity provider settings. Check the AM Gateway log and audit logs for more information.
