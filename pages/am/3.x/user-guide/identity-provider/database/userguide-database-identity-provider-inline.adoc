== Overview

Inline identity providers are based on in-memory user directories. They are useful for testing purposes or setting default accounts.

== Create an inline identity provider

To create an identity provider:

. link:{{ '/am/current/am_userguide_authentication.html' | relative_url }}[Log in to AM Console^].
. Click *Settings > Providers*.
. Click the plus icon image:{% link images/icons/plus-icon.png %}[role="icon"].
. Select *Inline* as your identity provider type and click *Next*.
. Give your identity provider a name.
. Configure the settings.
. Click *Create*.

NOTE: If you want to register multiple users, click the *Add user* button before clicking on the *Create* button.

You can also create the identity provider with link:{{ '/am/current/management-api/index.html' | relative_url }}[AM API].

NOTE: New in Gravitee.io AM 3.4.x

You can choose how passwords are encoded or hashed with the following algorithms:

- `bcrypt`
- none (plain text)

WARNING: If you decide to switch from `bcrypt` to none, you must update all password fields before saving.

== Test the connection

You can test your database connection using a web application created in AM.

. In AM Console, click *Applications* and select your inline identity provider.

+
. Call the Login page (i.e `/oauth/authorize` endpoint) and try to sign in with the username/password form.

If you are unable to authenticate your user, there may be a problem with the identity provider settings. Check the AM Gateway log and audit logs for more information.
