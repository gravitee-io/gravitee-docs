== Overview

You can authenticate users in AM with the most common databases, including:

- PostgreSQL
- MySQL
- Microsoft SQL Server
- MariaDB

You do this by creating a new JDBC identity provider.

NOTE: Before you begin, you need to ensure that your database has the appropriate fields to store user profile attributes, such as `id`, `username`, `email`, `password` and `metadata`.

== Create a SQL database identity provider

. link:/am/current/am_userguide_authentication.html[Log in to AM Console^].
. If you want to change to a different security domain, select it from the user menu at the top right.
. Click *Settings > Providers*.
. Click the plus icon image:icons/plus-icon.png[].
. Select *JDBC* as your identity provider type and click *Next*.
. Give your identity provider a name.
. Configure the database settings as required.

== Test the connection

You can test your database connection using a web application created in AM.

. In AM Console, click *Applications* and select your JDBC identity provider.

. Call the Login page (i.e `/oauth/authorize` endpoint) and try to sign in with the username/password form.

If you are unable to authenticate your user, there may be a problem with the identity provider settings. Check the AM Gateway log and audit logs for more information.
