== Introduction

You can use Extension Points to extend the behavior of AM by executing link:/am/current/am_devguide_policies[policies] during the `OnRequest` step of selected stages.

== Execution context

Each policy has access to the `Execution Context` to retrieve and set information required to execute the policy code.

The `Execution Context` data will be propagated to the next steps to be used later on (e.g custom HTML forms).

In this example we are getting `Execution Context` data using the link:/apim_publisherguide_expression_language.html[Gravitee.io Expression Language]:

----
{#request} : Current HTTP Request with parameters, headers, path, ...
{#context.attributes['client']} : OAuth 2.0 Client (if available) with clientId, clientName, ...
{#context.attributes['user']} : Authenticated User (if available) with username, firstName, lastName, email, roles, ...
----

== Extension points

Policies are executed only against selected steps throughout the request process.

The following is a list of the available extension points:

* link:/am/current/am_userguide_policies_extension_points.html#pre_end_user_consent[Pre End-User Consent]: happens after the user has logged in. It allows you to fetch more information or validate incoming data before displaying the User Consent HTML Page.
* link:/am/current/am_userguide_policies_extension_points.html#post_end_user_consent[Post End-User Consent]: happens after the user has given his consent to the processing of personal data. It allows you to validate incoming data (user consent) before giving access to the application.

NOTE: More extension points will be added to future releases of Gravitee.io AM.
