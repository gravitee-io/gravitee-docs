== Overview

When a new domain is created, a certificate is generated for use by the domain applications to sign the tokens. Such certificates are marked as "system" certificates. 

== How to define system certificate properties

System certificates are generated based on the Management API settings that allow the definition of:

* the key size (default value: `2048`)
* the certificate alias (default value: `default`)
* the validity of the certificate, measured in days (default value: `365`)
* the algorithm used to sign tokens (default value: `SHA256withRSA`)
* the X.500 name of the certificate (default value: `cn=Gravitee.io`)

To set or modify these values, update the `domains.certificates` section in the `gravitee.yaml` file of the Management API service.

domains:
  certificates:
    default:
      keysize: 2048
      alias: default
      keypass: gravitee
      storepass: gravitee
      validity: 365             # Validity of the certificate
      algorithm: SHA256withRSA  # Algorithm used to sign certificate
      name: cn=Gravitee.io      # Certificate X.500 name

You can define these properties in the `values.yaml` file of the AM Helm Chart.

== Certificate rotation

[label label-version]#New in 3.20#

Like all certificates, a system certificate has a given validity period, after which tokens will not be valid anymore. The certificate rotation feature enables you to generate a new system certificate quickly and easily when the previous one is about to expire - just click the "Rotate system key" button to create a new system certificate and assign it to the applications of your domain that are currently using the previous system certificate. The applications update is done asynchronously 10 minutes after the certificate generation in order to avoid JWKS caching issues on the client side.

NOTE: See link:{{ 'am/current/am_installguide_management_api_configuration.html#configure_notifications_on_certificates_expiry' | relative_url }}[this documentation page^] for details on how to configure notifications about certificate expiry.

=== How to configure the applications update

To adapt the duration of the applications update after a system certificate generation, update the `domains.certificates.default.refresh` section in the `gravitee.yaml` file of the Management API service.

[source, yaml]
----
domains:
  certificates:
    default:
      keysize: 2048
      alias: default
      keypass: gravitee
      storepass: gravitee
      validity: 365             # Validity of the certificate
      algorithm: SHA256withRSA  # Algorithm used to sign certificate
      name: cn=Gravitee.io      # Certificate X.500 name
      # Refresh section is used to define the delay between a system certificate renewal and the applications update to use this new certificate
      refresh:
        delay: 10
        timeUnit: MINUTES
----

You can define these properties in the `values.yaml` file of the AM Helm Chart.

  domains:
    certificates:
      default:
        keysize: 2048

        storepass: gravitee
        validity: 365             # Validity of the certificate
        algorithm: SHA256withRSA  # Algorithm used to sign certificate
        name: cn=Gravitee.io      # Certificate X.500 name
        refresh:
          delay: 10
