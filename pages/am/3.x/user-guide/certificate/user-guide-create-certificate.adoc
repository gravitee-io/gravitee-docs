Certificates are created for each security domain, to create a certificate, follow these steps :

. Go to http://GRAVITEEIO-AM-UI-HOST
. From the homepage, go to your security domain's settings page, go to `Certificates` section
. From the security domain's certificates page, click `(+)` button
. Choose the certificate's type and press `NEXT`

== Java KeyStore (JKS)

Storage for cryptographic keys and certificates based on the (.jks) file.

NOTE: To generate a new keystore, you can use the Key and Certificate Management Tool `keytool`

[source]
----
$ keytool -genkeypair
          -alias mytestkey
          -keyalg RSA
          -dname "CN=Web Server,OU=Unit,O=Organization,L=City,S=State,C=US"
          -keypass changeme
          -keystore server.jks
          -storepass letmein
----

TIP: Default key are RS256 (SHA256withRSA), for RS512 key add those following options: -sigalg SHA512withRSA -keysize 4096

. Give your certificate a *name* and create a certificate by filling out the configuration form and press `CREATE`

You can also create a certificate via the Gravitee.io AM API

[source]
----
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer :accessToken" \
     -H "Content-Type:application/json;charset=UTF-8" \
     -X POST \
     -d '{
           "type": "javakeystore-am-certificate",
           "name": "Java KeyStore",
           "configuration": "{\"jks\":\"{\"name\":\"server.jks\",\"type\":\"\",\"size\":2236,\"content\":\"base64EncodingFile\",\"storepass\":\"letmein\",\"alias\":\"mytestkey\",\"keypass\":\"changeme\"}"
         }'

== Public keys

Public keys will allow you to verify the token's payload integrity. To get public key of your certificate, follow these steps :

. From `Certificates` list page, click image:am/current/graviteeio-am-quickstart-profile-public-key.png[] button.
. You can copy/paste the public to use them with third party library to verify your tokens

NOTE: link:https://gravitee.io[Gravitee.io API Management] comes with a JWT Policy use to verify and decode tokens that can be used for your APIs.

== Use the certificate for your application

To use your certificate for your application, follow these steps :

. Go to the `Settings` tab of your API and the `Certificates` section
. Choose your certificate and press `SAVE`

Gravitee.io Access Management is a flexible and extensible solution based on pluggable modules architecture.
You can develop your own certificate and provide a sign method for tokens.
