== How to view audit log

The Audit Log page of the Portal UI displays all events that occur, including user authentications and administrative actions such as managing Clients, Identity Providers, Users, Groups, Roles ...

. Go to http://GRAVITEEIO-AM-UI-HOST
. From the homepage, go to your security domain's settings page and go to `Audit Log` section

NOTE: All these information can be retrieved via the link:/am/current/management-api/index.html#tag/audit[AM Management API].

== Retention log and storage

Audit events are managed (store and fetch) by plugins call link:/apim_overview_plugins.html#gravitee-plugins-reporters[Reporter].

By default a Reporter is created for each security domain and allow you to choose where the audit logs will be stored.

NOTE: Currently only a MongoDB reporter is available but the Gravitee.io plugins system will ease the creation of new reporters (Splunk, Logstash, ES, ...)

. Go to http://GRAVITEEIO-AM-UI-HOST
. From the homepage, go to your security domain's settings page and go to `Audit Log` section
. Click on the "settings" icon and configure the reporter
