Any authenticated users who want to invalidate their session can call the following URL : `https://AM_GATEWAY_HOST/{domain}/logout`

NOTE: By default access tokens and refresh tokens are not revoked. You can add the `invalidate_tokens=true` query parameter to the request to invalidate current user tokens.

NOTE: You can also specify the `target_url=http://myApp/logoutCallback` query parameter to redirect the user to your application after logout process.
