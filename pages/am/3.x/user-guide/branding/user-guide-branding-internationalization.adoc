[label label-version]#New in version 3.19#

== Overview

AM supports internationalization in multiple languages so that end users can benefit from a great user experience.

The internationalization option is available under the domain `*Design -> Texts*` section

NOTE: Under the hood all the templates uses Thymeleaf and Freemarker engines to support translation.

== Customize translation

NOTE: The *3.19.0* release supports English and French languages out of the box.

To create a new language or customize texts for a default supported language:

. link:{{ '/am/current/am_userguide_authentication.html' | relative_url }}[Log in to AM Console^].
. Click *Settings > Texts*.
. Click `*ADD A NEW LANGUAGE*` button in the `*Languages*` section.

[start=8]
. Provide a valid property key name and value that you want to customize.
. Click `*ADD*` and then `*SAVE CHANGES*`.

NOTE: You should be able to view the change immediately in the `*Theme*` preview section for the template.

== Limitations

* The default locale is based on the end user's web browser - the requested language cannot be overridden with a query parameter such as *ui_locales*.

== Out-of-the-box translated properties

The default forms and email templates contain a set of translated properties, which are listed below.

NOTE: For example, if you want to support Spanish and translate the Login page title,
you can create a new Spanish Language and fill in the `login.title` property key translation.
