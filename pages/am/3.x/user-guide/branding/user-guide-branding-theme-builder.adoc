== Overview

The Theme Builder enables you to create a unique look and feel for your AM templates so they are aligned with your brand requirements.
The Theme Builder makes it easier to add custom CSS and the organization's logo in the templates, and to preview the changes - all in one place.

The Theme Builder is available in the domain `*Design*` section. A brief description of the builder follows below:

* The `*Settings*` include the following sections:
    ** `*General*`: inputs for logo, favicon URL, and theme color palette.
    ** `*Custom CSS*`: a place to add custom CSS (suitable for more advanced users).
* The `*Preview*` section on the right-hand side of `*Settings*` lets you switch between preview mode and HTML mode - suitable for more advanced customizations.
* `*PUBLISH*` button: saves the custom theme and templates.
* `*RESET THE THEME*` button: deletes the custom theme settings and resets the builder to the default theme.


== Updating the brand logo and the theme color

It is straightforward to update the brand logo and the theme color. All changes are immediately visible in the preview section.

NOTE: Logo, favicon, and theme color are applied for all the default pages provided by AM.
If you want to customize a specific page, you must select your page and switch to the HTML mode to enable and publish custom HTML templates - for example, if third-party logo URLs have been used for logo and favicon and a theme color has been selected to preview the login page.


NOTE: The content Security Policy (CSP) will prevent third-party URL access unless it has been set as permitted.
