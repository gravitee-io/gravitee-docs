AM can be customized to suit your organization's brand requirements and user expectations.
AM branding gives you a consistent user experience when navigating between customer applications and AM server.

You can create customized templates for individual applications or across all applications in a security domain.

NOTE: AM uses link:https://www.thymeleaf.org/[Thymeleaf^] syntax to dynamically customize your templates with execution context values such as the current application, the current end user and the current HTTP request.

For more information on customizing templates, see the following sections:
