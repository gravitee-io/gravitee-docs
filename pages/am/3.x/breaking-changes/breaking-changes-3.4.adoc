== Gateway Cookie Session

Since the beginning, AM Gateway has been using a server side session to back up some context information during user authentication flow (such as login, passwordless, multi-factor, consent).

In most cases, this server session was lost when 2 consecutive calls were handled on 2 different gateway instances.

To avoid this problem, the simplest solution was to configure a sticky on the load balancer in front of the gateways but the problem sometimes still occurred during redeploy or auto scaling phases.

*The server session has been replaced with a minimalist Cookie Session in the 3.4 version.*
To make sure the user's context is well propagated between each step of the authentication flow, most of the *form's actions and links must be updated*.

NOTE: If you are using custom form templates do not forget to run the link:{{ '/am/current/am_installguide_migration.html#upgrade_to_3_4_0' | relative_url }}[3.4 upgrade guide].

== provider_id managed into the state parameter

Since the beginning, when an Social Identity Provider is configured in AM the callback URL contains the `provider_id` query parameter. Because some Identity Providers do not accept a callback URL containing parameters, this information has been removed from the callback URL and is now part of the state parameter. 

After an upgrade to AM 3.4, please update the callback URL for each IDP definition into your Identity Provider administration console.
