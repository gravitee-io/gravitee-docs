== OpenId Connect: `openid` and `full_profile`

Until now, whenever a user consented to the `openid` scope:

* If no requested claim was provided, the `full_profile` scope was implicit
* Otherwise only the requested claims were provided

From now on, you will have to explicitly request the `full_profile` scope claim to get the entire user profile information.
