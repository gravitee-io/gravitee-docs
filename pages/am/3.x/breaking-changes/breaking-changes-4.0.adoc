== MongoDB indexes name

Starting from AM 4.0, the MongoDB indexes are now named using the first letter of the fields that compose the index. This change will allow to manage automatically indexes creation on DocumentDB. This change requires the execution of a MongoDB script to delete AM indexes and recreate them. Please see  **the migration guide available link:{{ '/am/current/am_installguide_migration.html' | relative_url }}[here]**.
