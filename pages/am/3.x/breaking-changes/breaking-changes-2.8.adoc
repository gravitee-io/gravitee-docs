== Username/email case sensitivity

Starting from version 2.8, username and email are case insensitive for the default MongoDB Identity Provider (use to store AM users).

This feature will prevent the situation where a user `userA` and `usera` in the system which refer to different accounts.
Moreover, users will be able to use their username and email independent of the case to log in and manage their account (e.g reset password).

WARNING: In order to authenticate your existing users you MUST run the following MongoDB script to update the user model.

NOTE: Each domain has a default MongoDB Identity Provider which stores the users in the collection : `idp_users_xxx`. Be sure to apply the following script for every collections.

----
Update AM users model

$ vi users-xxx-migration.js

-------
print('Users migration');
db.idp_users_xxx.find().forEach(
    function (user) {
        print("    update the user", user._id);
        db.idp_users_xxx.updateOne(
            { _id: user._id },
            { $set: { username: user.username.toLowerCase() }});
    }
);
-------

// do not forget to apply this script for every idp_users_xxx collection !!!
$ mongo localhost:27017/gravitee-am users-xxx-migration.js
