== Human readable identifier (hrid) for security domains

Since the beginning of AM, the technical id of a security domain was generated from the security domain's name.

For technical debt reasons we have move the technical id to an UUID format and introduced a new field called HRID, to keep readable URLs from the Console UI.

To provide this evolution, the execution of database migration script is required (see link:{{ '/am/current/am_installguide_migration.html' | relative_url }}[Migration Guide]).
