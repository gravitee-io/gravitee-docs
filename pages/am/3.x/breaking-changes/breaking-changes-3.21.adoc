== Docker images

From this version, to be complient with https://www.tenable.com/audits/items/CIS_Docker_v1.3.1_L1_Docker_Linux.audit:bdcea17ac365110218526796ae3095b1[CIS_Docker_v1.3.1_L1] the docker images are now using the user `graviteeio`
This means that if you use the official images and deploy them to Kubernetes, nothing changes.
If you build your own Dockerfile from Gravitee images, you must give the right rights to the modifications you add.
If you deploy in `openshift`, you have to add the following configure:

```yaml
securityContext:
    runAsGroup: 1000
```
