== Docker images

From this version, to be compliant with https://www.tenable.com/audits/items/CIS_Docker_v1.3.1_L1_Docker_Linux.audit:bdcea17ac365110218526796ae3095b1[CIS_Docker_v1.3.1_L1] the docker images are now use the `graviteeio` user
This means that if you use the official images and deploy them on your k8s installation, nothing changes.
If you build your own Dockerfile from Gravitee images, you must give the correct rights according to your modifications.
If you deploy on `openshift`, you have to add the following configuration:

```yaml
securityContext:
    runAsGroup: 1000
```
