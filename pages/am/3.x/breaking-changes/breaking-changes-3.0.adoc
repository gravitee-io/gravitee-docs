== Default Organization and default Environment

Starting from version 3.0.0, new concepts such as `Organization` and `Environment` have been introduced.
These concepts are part of our new "Multi-env (Cockipt)" feature which will be launched later this year.
You will be able to :

- Manage your environments from a single console
- Associate a Portal to each of your environment
- Be able to promote your security domains from an environment to an other
- and so on ...

Environments may be :

- Technical: qual, pre-prod, prod
- Target-oriented: private portal, partners portal, public portal
- Business-oriented: marketing portal, financial portal, commercial portal

To prepare this new feature, a `DEFAULT` organization and an `DEFAULT` environment have been created and bring some changes to the AM Management API base URL.
In order to call the AM Management API, you should now use those URLs:

----
AM Management API 2.x

  - http(s)://AM_MANAGEMENT_API/management/domains/**

AM Management API 3.x

  - http(s)://AM_MANAGEMENT_API/management/organizations/DEFAULT/environments/DEFAULT/domains/**
----

NOTE: If you are using the AM Management API directly (not via the Portal) please update your configuration.

== Admin domain has been removed

Gravitee.io Access Management 2.x came with a default link:{{ '/am/2.x/am_userguide_admin_domain.html' | relative_url }}[Admin security domain] to perform all the Gravitee.io AM management tasks.
This domain has been removed and replaced by the new concept of `Organization` described above.

If you were using the management api to administrate the `admin` domain you should now use this URL:

----
AM Management API 2.x

  - http(s)://AM_MANAGEMENT_API/management/domains/admin/**

AM Management API 3.x

  - http(s)://AM_MANAGEMENT_API/management/organizations/DEFAULT/environments/DEFAULT/**
----

NOTE: If you used to get a security token via the following URL `http(s)://AM_MANAGEMENT_API/admin/token` you now must call this endpoint `http(s)://AM_MANAGEMENT_API/management/auth/token`.

== Clients are deprecated

Starting from v3.0.0 `Clients` concept has been replaced by `Applications` concept for several reasons :

- Improve user experience and comprehension
- Require less knowledge about security protocol (OAuth 2.0 / OIDC)
- Simplify client management within Access Management
- Align the “application” vision between API Management & Access Management
- Apply best security options according to the type of application
- Seamless integration with Dynamic Client Registration

NOTE: All `/domains/:domainId/clients/**` routes have been deprecated and will be removed in a next version.
See the new link:{{ '/am/current/management-api/index.html' | relative_url }}[AM v3 OpenAPI descriptor] for more information.

----
AM Management API 2.x

  - http(s)://AM_MANAGEMENT_API/management/domains/:domainId/clients/**

AM Management API 3.x

  - http(s)://AM_MANAGEMENT_API/management/organization/DEFAULT/environment/DEFAULT/domains/:domainId/applications/**
----

== Portal ACLs and permissions

Since the first version of Gravitee.io Access Management each administrative users of the portal could do everything with no restriction.
Gravitee.io AM v3 allows you to manage what we call `Administrative roles` that can be used to grant access to specific areas of resources such as the platform, a security domain or an application.

NOTE: To ensure a seamlessly migration to the v3 each current administrative users will have the `ORGANIZATION_OWNER` role.

NOTE: Read more about roles and permissions thanks to our link:{{ '/am/current/am_adminguide_roles_and_permissions.html' | relative_url }}[Administration Guide].

== Enforce Security

=== CSRF

NOTE: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they’re currently authenticated.
For more information please visit link:https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html[CSRF Prevention Cheat Sheet].

In previous version only the main web forms (Login, Register, Reset password) were protected from CSRF attack.
Starting from v3 all the remaining HTML pages have built-in CSRF protection.

Note that the management portal is now protected against CSRF attacks too.

WARNING: If you are using link:{{ '/am/current/am_userguide_user_management_forms.html' | relative_url }}[Custom forms], please make sure to add this HTML element `<input type="hidden" th:name="${_csrf.parameterName}" th:value="${_csrf.token}"/>` to your form content.

=== Password policy

Default password policy has been updated to fulfill OWASP recommendations.

Starting from v3 user's password must follow these requirements :

* 8 to 32 characters
* no more than 2 consecutive equal characters
* at least 1 special characters (@ & # ...)
* at least 1 upper case character

NOTE: You still have the possibility to define your own password policy to match your security needs.
Have a look at the user.password.policy.pattern configuration property.
