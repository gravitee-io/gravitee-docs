== User consents

Starting from version 2.5, User Consent Management has been developed to capture and manage consent.

User Consent (known also as Scope Approval from Gravitee.io AM point of view) internal structure has changed to fulfill consent management requirements.

It means that User Consent from 1.x/current version are now incompatible with the 2.5 version.

NOTE: If you switch from 2.x to 2.5 with active user consents, your client applications should probably need to re-ask for consents from the end-user.
