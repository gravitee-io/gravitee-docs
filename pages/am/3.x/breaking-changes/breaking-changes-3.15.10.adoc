== ResetPassword HTTP Identity Provider

If you are using `HTTPIdentityProvider` with `UserProvider` enabled, please note that this version introduces a new user password update method that is different from the existing `UpdateUser` one. As a result, to avoid errors during password updates, ensure that this endpoint is configured correctly.
