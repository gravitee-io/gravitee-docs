== OAuth 2.0 access and refresh tokens

Starting from version 2.x, OAuth 2.0 access token and refresh token internal structure have changed for more simplicity and flexibility.

Which means that OAuth 2.0 tokens (access and refresh) from 1.x version are now incompatible with the 2.x
and lead you to `token not recognized` for link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7662[OAuth 2.0 Token Introspection] and link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-6[Refreshing an Access Token].

NOTE: If you switch from 1.x to 2.x with active tokens, your client applications should probably need to re-login the end-user.

== Custom plugins

Moving from a synchronous to Reactive programming architecture implies that we have changed some of our API signatures.

If you have written some custom plugins such as custom identity providers, extension grants or repositories, please follow these steps to update your plugins :

1. Update the `gravitee-plugin-api` to the `2.x.x` version of the `pom.xml` file (see below an example with a custom identity provider)

[source,xml]
----
<dependencies>
    <!-- Gravitee.io -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.gravitee.am.identityprovider</groupId>
        <artifactId>gravitee-am-identityprovider-api</artifactId>
        <version>2.x.x</version>
        <scope>provided</scope>
    </dependency>
    ...
</dependencies>
----

[start=2]
2. Mandatory interfaces will change to their link:http://reactivex.io/[Rx], link:https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava[RxJava 2] version
3. Update your code and re-build the plugin
4. Replace your zip file in the `plugins` folder
5. Start the Gravitee.io AM processes

== OpenID Connect

Starting from Gravitee.io AM *2.0.4*, OpenID Connect endpoints have been moved under `/oidc` base path.
