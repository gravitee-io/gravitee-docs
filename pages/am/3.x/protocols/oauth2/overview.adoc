== Overview

link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749[OAuth 2.0] is the industry-standard protocol for authorization providing specific authorization flows for web applications, desktop applications, mobile phones, and living room devices.

OAuth 2.0 specifies standard endpoints to interact with the resource owner (or the client when is acting on its own behalf) to grant/introspect/revoke tokens used to access protected resources.

You can find OAuth 2.0 protocol endpoints exposed by Gravitee.io Access Management :

* link:/am/current/oauth2/index.html[OAuth 2.0 API Console, window="_blank"] - link:/am/current/oauth2/swagger.yml[Swagger spec, window="_blank"]

== Roles

OAuth 2.0 defines four roles:

* `resource owner`
      An entity capable of granting access to a protected resource.
      When the resource owner is a person, it is referred to as an
      end-user.

* `resource server`
      The server hosting the protected resources, capable of accepting
      and responding to protected resource requests using access tokens.

* `client`
      An application making protected resource requests on behalf of the
      resource owner and with its authorization.  The term "client" does
      not imply any particular implementation characteristics (e.g.,
      whether the application executes on a server, a desktop, or other
      devices).

* `authorization server`
      The server issuing access tokens to the client after successfully
      authenticating the resource owner and obtaining authorization.

== Protocol flow

The OAuth 2.0 flow describes the interaction between the four roles and includes the following steps:

* The client requests authorization from the resource owner.  The
        authorization request can be made directly to the resource owner
        (as shown), or preferably indirectly via the authorization
        server as an intermediary.

* The client receives an authorization grant, which is a
        credential representing the resource owner's authorization,
        expressed using one of four grant types defined in this
        specification or using an extension grant type.  The
        authorization grant type depends on the method used by the
        client to request authorization and the types supported by the
        authorization server.

* The client requests an access token by authenticating with the
        authorization server and presenting the authorization grant.

* The authorization server authenticates the client and validates
        the authorization grant, and if valid, issues an access token.

* The client requests the protected resource from the resource
        server and authenticates by presenting the access token.

* The resource server validates the access token, and if valid,
        serves the request.

NOTE: The preferred method for the client to obtain an authorization grant from the resource owner is to use the authorization server as an intermediary (i.e Authorization Code Flow).

== Authorization Grant

An authorization grant is a flow used by the client to obtain an access token.
The specification defines four grant types -- authorization code, implicit, resource owner password credentials, and client credentials -- as well as an extensibility mechanism for defining additional types.
The use of one of these grant types will mainly depend of your application type.

=== Authorization Code

The authorization code is obtained by using an authorization server as an intermediary between the client and resource owner.

NOTE: Flow used in web (server side) and mobile apps. For native application (mobile app), you should also use the link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636[PKCE extension], which provides protections against other attacks where the authorization code may be intercepted.

NOTE: Authorization Code grant URL : GET https://am-gateway/{domain}/oauth/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=web-app&redirect_uri=https://web-app/callback

=== Implicit

The implicit grant is a simplified authorization code flow.

NOTE: Flow optimized for clients implemented in a browser using a scripting language such as JavaScript

NOTE: Implicit grant URL : GET https://am-gateway/{domain}/oauth/authorize?response_type=token&client_id=web-app&redirect_uri=https://web-app/callback

=== Resource Owner Password Credentials

The resource owner password credentials (i.e., username and password) can be used directly as an authorization grant to obtain an access token (in REST manner)

NOTE: Should only be used when there is a high degree of trust between the resource owner and the client (e.g., the client is part of the device operating system or a highly privileged application), and when other authorization grant types are not available (such as an authorization code)

NOTE: Resource Owner Password Credentials grant URL : POST https://am-gateway/{domain}/oauth/token?grant_type=password&username=john&password=doe (with Basic client credentials)

=== Client Credentials

The Client Credentials grant type is used by clients to obtain an access token outside of the context of a user. This is typically used by clients to access resources about themselves rather than to access a user's resources.

NOTE: Flow used typically when the client is acting on its own behalf (the client is also the resource owner). Machine to machine communication

NOTE: Client Credentials grant URL : POST https://am-gateway/{domain}/oauth/token?grant_type=client_credentials (with Basic client credentials)

=== Refresh Token

A refresh token is used to get a new access token letting client application to renew access to protected resources without prompting login page to the resource owner.

NOTE: For security reason (a user can remain authenticated forever), a refresh token must be stored in secure place (i.e server side) and the client MUST discard the old refresh token and replace it with the new refresh token.

NOTE: Refresh token grant URL : POST https://am-gateway/{domain}/oauth/token?grant_type=refresh_token&refresh_token={refreshToken} (with Basic client credentials)

== Endpoints

=== Authorization Endpoint

link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-3.1[The authorization endpoint] is used to interact with the resource owner and obtain an authorization grant.
The authorization server MUST first verify the identity of the resource owner.

NOTE: Authorization endpoint URL : https://am-gateway/{domain}/oauth/authorize

=== Token Endpoint

link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-3.2[The token endpoint] is used by the client to obtain an access token by presenting its authorization grant or refresh token.

NOTE: Authorization endpoint URL : https://am-gateway/{domain}/oauth/token

=== Introspection Endpoint

link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7662#section-2[The introspection endpoint] is an OAuth 2.0 endpoint that takes a parameter representing an OAuth 2.0 token and returns a JSON [RFC7159] document representing the meta information surrounding the token, including whether this token is currently active.

NOTE: Introspection endpoint URL : https://am-gateway/{domain}/oauth/introspect

=== Revocation Endpoint

link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7009[The revocation endpoint] is an OAuth 2.0 endpoint which allows clients to notify the authorization server that a previously obtained refresh or access token is no longer needed.

NOTE: Revocation endpoint URL : https://am-gateway/{domain}/oauth/revoke

== Concrete example

Let's imagine that a user want to access his personal data via a web application. The personal data are exposed through an API secured by OAuth 2.0 protocol.

1. The user must be logged in to access his data. He asks the web application to sign in
2. The web application sends an Authorization Request (resource owner ask to grant access to his data) to the Authorization Server
