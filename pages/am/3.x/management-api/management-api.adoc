== Available authorizations

Management API is protect by a token-based authentication which allows you to call the Management API resources.

NOTE: Use the HTTP Authorization request header (`Authorization Bearer token`) to call the Management API. You can also use `Authorization="Bearer token"` cookie to access the Management API resources.

=== Token endpoint

The token endpoint is used to obtain `AM Management API's token` by presenting user credentials via the `Basic authentication scheme`.

The following example, exchange default admin account credentials (admin/adminadmin) for a token.

```
POST /admin/token HTTP/1.1

curl -X POST \
  http://GRAVITEE_AM_MGT_API_HOST/admin/token \
  -H 'authorization: Basic base64(admin:adminadmin)' \

      "expires_at": "Thu Jun 28 10:35:31 CEST 2018",
      "token_type": "bearer"
  }
```
