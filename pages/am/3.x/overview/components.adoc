== Overview

This page describes the main components included in AM.

== AM Gateway
AM Gateway is the core component of the AM platform.
It acts as a trust broker with your identity providers and provides an authentication and authorization flow for your users.

== AM APIs
These RESTful APIs expose services to:

* Manage and configure the AM platform
* Manage users and user sessions
* Manage the authorization flow for OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, UMA 2.0 and SCIM 2.0 protocols

All exposed services are restricted by authentication and authorization rules. You can find more information in the link:am_devguide_protocols_overview.html[API Reference^] section.

== AM Console
This web UI acts as a graphical interface to the AM API functionality.
