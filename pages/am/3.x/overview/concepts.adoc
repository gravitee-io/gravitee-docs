A security domain:

* Gives you access to all the AM resources, such as applications, users and identity providers
* Exposes authentication and authorization URLs
* Gathers analytics and reporting

An application:

* Can be any type of application, for example:
** Web Application (PHP, Java, Node.js)
** Single App (JavaScript)
** Native App (iOS, Android)

* Applications use AM to sign in and make requests to the Gateway Authorization Server
* Applications can be used by end users (B2C) or autonomous (B2B)

An identity provider:

* Brokers trust with external user providers such as:
** LDAP / Active Directory
** Database
** Web services
** Social providers
** OpenID Connect providers
** SAML v2 IDP
** Custom providers
* Is used during the login process to verify user credentials and retrieve profile information

[[gravitee-am-concepts-extension-point]]

* Customizes the authentication and authorization flow by:
** Adding extra actions after the login form process
