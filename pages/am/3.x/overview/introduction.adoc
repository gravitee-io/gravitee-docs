== Gravitee.io Access Management

Gravitee.io Access Management (AM) is a flexible, lightweight and easy to use open source Identity and Access Management solution.
It offers a centralized authentication and authorization service to deliver secure access for authorized users to your applications and APIs from any device.

== Authorization in AM

AM is based on OAuth2/OpenID Connect protocols and acts as an identity provider broker.

=== OAuth2

OAuth2 is an authorization framework that allows applications acting on behalf of the end user to obtain limited access to HTTP services.
link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749[OAuth 2 RFC^] defines two endpoints:

- The *authorization endpoint* used to interact with the resource owner and obtain an authorization grant via user-agent redirection.
- The *token endpoint* used by the client to obtain an access token by presenting its authorization grant.

For further information about OAuth2, view the link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749[RFC page^].

=== OpenID Connect

OpenID Connect is an identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol.
It enables clients to verify the identity of the end user by using an Authorization Server to authenticate and obtain basic profile information about the end user.

For further information about OpenID Connect, see the link:http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html[OpenID Connect specifications^].
