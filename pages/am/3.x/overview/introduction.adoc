== Gravitee.io Access Management

Gravitee.io Access Management (AM) is a flexible, lightweight and easy to use open source Identity and Access Management solution.
It offers a centralized authentication and authorization service to deliver secure access for authorized users to your applications and APIs from any device.

== Authentication and Authorization

Authentication and Authorization are key terms of Identity and Access Management (IAM) that describe similar, yet quite distinct, concepts.

=== Authentication

Authentication in IAM is all about proving *who we are*. With AM we want to be certain that our APIs can only be accessed by users
that are known to us and who have proven their _identity_.

=== Authorization

We may not want *all* of our _authenticated_ users to access to *all* of our APIs. If we want to control *who* has access to *what*, we need _authorization_.

== Authorization in AM

AM is based on OAuth2/OpenID Connect and SAML 2.0 protocols and acts as an identity provider broker

=== OAuth2

OAuth2 is an authorization framework that allows applications acting on behalf of the end user to obtain limited access to HTTP services.
link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749[OAuth 2 RFC^] defines two endpoints:

- The *authorization endpoint* used to interact with the resource owner and obtain an authorization grant via user-agent redirection.
- The *token endpoint* used by the client to obtain an access token by presenting its authorization grant.

For further information about OAuth2, view the link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749[RFC page^].

=== OpenID Connect

OpenID Connect is an identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol.
It enables clients to verify the identity of the end user by using an Authorization Server to authenticate and obtain basic profile information about the end user.

For further information about OpenID Connect, view the link:http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html[OpenID Connect specifications^].

=== SAML 2.0

The Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) protocol is an open-standard, XML-based framework for authentication and authorization of users.

Gravitee AM can act as both SAML IdP for applications as well as federate with SAML based Identity Providers for protocol mediation.

For further information about SAML 2.0, view the link:http://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/Post2.0/sstc-saml-tech-overview-2.0.html[SAML Tech Overview 2.0]
