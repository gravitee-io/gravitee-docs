== Overview

This section walks you through creating your first application. For more detailed instructions, see the link:/am/current/am_userguide_overview.html[User Guide].

In this example we will:

- Create a security domain for the application
- Create a new web application
- Create a new identity provider and associate it with the application
- Test the application

== Create a security domain

A _security domain_ is a series of security policies that apply to a set of applications which all share common security mechanisms for authentication, authorization and identity management.

NOTE: You only need to create a new security domain for an application when you do not have a suitable domain configured already. You can find a list of security domains in your user menu.

=== Create a domain with AM Console

. link:/am/current/am_userguide_authentication.html[Log in to AM Console^].
. From the user menu at the top right, click *Create domain*.
+

+
. Give your security domain a *Name* and a *Description* and click *CREATE*.
+

+
. Click on the banner *click here* link to enable the domain.

=== Create a domain with AM API

----
# create domain
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer :accessToken" \
     -H "Content-Type:application/json;charset=UTF-8" \
     -X POST \
     -d '{"name":"My First Security Domain","description":"My First Security Domain description"}' \
     http://GRAVITEEIO-AM-MGT-API-HOST/management/organizations/DEFAULT/environments/DEFAULT/domains

# enable domain
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer :accessToken" \
     -H "Content-Type:application/json;charset=UTF-8" \
     -X PATCH \
     -d '{"enabled": true}' \
     http://GRAVITEEIO-AM-MGT-API-HOST/management/organizations/DEFAULT/environments/DEFAULT/domains/:domainId
----

== Create an application

Before you can work with AM Gateway, you must create an _application_.
The application will provide the necessary information (such as the client ID and client Secret) for authentication and authorization.
The application can be a native mobile app, a single page front-end web application or a regular web application that executes on a server.

In this example, we will create a regular web application.

. Click *Applications*.
. In the Applications page, click the plus icon image:icons/plus-icon.png[role="icon"].
. Choose a *Web* application type.
+
image::am/current/quickstart-create-application.png[]
+
. Click the *Next* button.
. Give your application a *Name* and a *Redirect URI* (with https scheme and non localhost) and click the *Create* button.
+

NOTE: This application will be used by end users, so we need to bind them with an identity provider.

== Create an identity provider

An _identity provider_ is usually a service used to authenticate and communicate authorization and user information.
It can be a social provider like Facebook, Google or Twitter, an enterprise provider such as Active Directory or a custom provider such as a database.

In this example, we will create an In-memory identity provider with an inline user configuration.

. Click *Settings > Providers*.
. In the Identity Providers page, click the plus icon image:icons/plus-icon.png[].
. Choose *Inline* and click *Next*.
+
image::am/current/graviteeio-am-quickstart-idp-type.png[]
+
. Give your identity provider a *Name* and enter the user details, then click *Create*.

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer :accessToken" \
     -H "Content-Type:application/json;charset=UTF-8" \
     -X POST \
     -d '{
           "external": false,
           "type": "inline-am-idp",
           "configuration": "{\"users\":[{\"firstname\":\"John\",\"lastname\":\"Doe\",\"username\":\"johndoe\",\"password\":\"johndoepassword\"}]}",
           "name": "Inline IdP"
         }' \
     http://GRAVITEEIO-AM-MGT-API-HOST/management/organizations/DEFAULT/environments/DEFAULT/domains/:securityDomainPath/identities
----
+
. Click *Applications* and select your web application.
. In the *Identity Providers* tab, select *Inline identity provider* and click *SAVE*.

== Test your identity provider with OAuth2

You can now test your identity provider by requesting a token, as described in link:am_quickstart_profile_information.html#id_token[ID Token] in the next section.
