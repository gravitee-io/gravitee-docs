This section walks you through creating your first application with AM Console.

NOTE: If you are running AM with our link:/am/current/am_installguide_docker.html#docker_compose[Docker Compose image], the http://GRAVITEEIO-AM-UI-HOST must be https://localhost/am/ui.

== Create a security domain

A _security domain_ is a series of security policies apply to a set of applications that all share common security mechanisms for authentication, authorization and identity management.

. Log in to \http://GRAVITEEIO-AM-UI-HOST. Note that the default Administrator account is *admin/adminadmin*.
. From the homepage, click the *Create a Security Domain* button.
. Give your security domain a *name* and a *description* and click *CREATE*.
. Enable your domain by clicking on the banner *click here* link.

NOTE: You can create new security domains from the user menu (top right).

----
# create domain
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer :accessToken" \
     -H "Content-Type:application/json;charset=UTF-8" \
     -X POST \
     -d '{"name":"My First Security Domain","description":"My First Security Domain description"}' \
     http://GRAVITEEIO-AM-MGT-API-HOST/management/organizations/DEFAULT/environments/DEFAULT/domains


# enable domain
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer :accessToken" \
     -H "Content-Type:application/json;charset=UTF-8" \
     -X PATCH \
     -d '{"enabled": true}' \
     http://GRAVITEEIO-AM-MGT-API-HOST/management/organizations/DEFAULT/environments/DEFAULT/domains/:domainId

== Create your application

Before you can work with AM Gateway, you must create an application.
The application provides the necessary information (such as the client ID and client Secret) for authentication and authorization.
The application can be a native mobile app, a single page front-end web app or a regular web app that executes on a server.

Create your application as follows:

. Click *Applications*.
. Click the plus icon image:icons/plus-icon.png[].
. Choose *Backend to Backend* application type.
. Click the *Next* button.
. Give your application a *Name* and click the *Create* button.

----
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer :accessToken" \
     -H "Content-Type:application/json;charset=UTF-8" \
     -X POST \
     -d '{"name":"My App", "type": "SERVICE"}' \
     http://GRAVITEEIO-AM-MGT-API-HOST/management/organizations/DEFAULT/environments/DEFAULT/domains/:domainId/applications

== Test your application with OAuth2

OAuth 2.0 is an authorization framework that allows applications acting on behalf the end user to obtain limited access to HTTP services.
link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749[OAuth 2 RFC^] defines two endpoints:

- The *authorization endpoint* used to interact with the resource owner and obtain an authorization grant via user-agent redirection.
- The *token endpoint* used by the client to obtain an access token by presenting its authorization grant.

NOTE: For further information about OAuth2, see the link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749[RFC page^].

To validate the application configuration, we will request an access token.
From your application *Overview* section, you can copy the cURL command to start interacting with AM OAuth 2.0 endpoints.

Request a token::

[source]
----
curl -X POST \
  'http://GRAVITEEIO-AM-GATEWAY-HOST/:domainPath/oauth/token \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  -H 'Authorization: Basic Base64.encode64(:clientId + ':' + :clientSecret)' \
  -d 'grant_type=client_credentials'
----

[width="100%",cols="2,8",frame="topbot",options="header,footer"]
|==========================
|Parameter       |Description
|grant_type      |*REQUIRED.* Set the value to `client_credentials`.
|client_id       |*REQUIRED.* Client's ID. (Basic Auth)
|client_secret   |*REQUIRED.* Client's secret. (Basic Auth)
|scope           |*OPTIONAL.* The scopes of the access token.
|==========================

If everything is working correctly, you will see the following response:
