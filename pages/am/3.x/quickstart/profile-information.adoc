After you have authenticated your first users (see link:/am/current/am_quickstart_authenticate_users.html[Authenticate users with Identity provider^]) you can retrieve the user's profile information by using OpenID Connect.

NOTE: OpenID Connect is an identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol.
It enables Clients to verify the identity of the End-User based on the authentication performed by an Authorization Server, as well as to obtain basic profile information about the End-User.
See link:http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html[OpenID Connect specifications^] for more information.

Gravitee.io Access Management is based upon OAuth2/OpenID Connect protocols and act as an identity providers broker. It helps you obtaining and verifying the users' identity of your applications by issuing link:http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#IDToken[ID Token^] or calling the link:http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#UserInfo[UserInfo Endpoint^].

== ID Token

=== Get ID Token

The ID token is a signed link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-json-web-token-32[JSON Web Token (JWT)^] that contains user profile information, also known as `claims`.
These claims are statements about the Authentication of the End-User and can be trusted only if application consumers can verify its signature.
ID Token is self contained and supply all the necessary information about the current user without making additional HTTP requests.

You can retrieve an ID Token by requesting for an access token with the specific scope `openid`

. Go to your `Settings` application
. And then go to `OAuth 2.0 / OIDC` section
. Add `openid` scope and press `+ ADD`
. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click `SAVE`

Request a token::

curl -L -X POST 'http://GRAVITEEIO-AM-GATEWAY-HOST/:domainPath/oauth/token' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
-H 'Authorization: Basic Base64.encode(:clientId + ':' + :clientSecret)' \

--data-urlencode 'username=:username' \
--data-urlencode 'password=:password' \

=== Verify ID Token

ID token can be decoded and verified via 3rd-party JWT library that you can find at link:https://jwt.io/[JWT.IO website^].

ID token must contain at least the following link:http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#IDToken[required claims^] :

[width="100%",cols="2,8",frame="topbot",options="header,footer"]
|==========================
|Claim      |
|iss        |Issuer Identifier, must be the `oidc.iss` configuration value (default http://gravitee.am)
|sub        |Subject Identifier represented by the unique user's `username`
|aud        |Audience(s) that this ID Token is intended for. It MUST contain your OAuth 2.0 `client_id`.
|exp        |Expiration time on or after which the ID Token MUST NOT be accepted for processing.
|iat        |Time at which the JWT was issued.
|==========================

Finally, make sure that the ID token was signed by Gravitee.io Access Management.

. Go to the `Certificates` section of your security domain
. Retrieve your public key by clicking on image:am/current/graviteeio-am-quickstart-profile-public-key.png[] icon
. Use a JWT library to verify the signature.

NOTE: You can also use the link:https://gravitee.io[Gravitee.io API Management solution^] and the link:/apim_policies_jwt.html[JWT Policy^] to verify and retrieve user profile information.

== UserInfo Endpoint

In addition to the claims in the ID Token, OpenID Connect defines a standard protected endpoint, the link:http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#UserInfo[UserInfo Endpoint^], that returns claims about the current user by the access token.

Request a token::

[source,bash,subs="verbatim"]
----
curl -X GET http://GRAVITEEIO-AM-GATEWAY-HOST/:securityDomainPath/oidc/userinfo -H 'Authorization: Bearer :access_token'
----

If everything goes well, you should see the following response :

[source]
----
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, max-age=0, must-revalidate
Pragma: no-cache

  "name": "John Doe",
  "preferred_username": "johndoe",
  "given_name": "John",
  "family_name": "Doe"
}
----

== Custom claims

Identity provider serves default claims such as the user's `username`, `given_name`, `family_name`, ... . You can add custom claims by overriding identity provider's configuration.

=== Add new user information

. Go to the `Providers` section of your security domain
. Select your Identity Provider and click on `User Mappers` tab
. Map new custom claims with user attributes contained in your user data store

image::am/current/graviteeio-am-quickstart-profile-user-mappers.png[]

[start=4]
. Custom user attributes will be available in the UserInfo Endpoint response.

TIP: more information about User mapping to be found in the dedicated section: link:/am/current/am_userguide_identity_provider_mapping.html[User and role mapping^].
