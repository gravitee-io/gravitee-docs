== Overview

User-Managed Access (UMA) is an OAuth-based protocol designed to give to an individual a unified control point for authorizing who and what can get access to their digital data, content and services, no matter where all those things live.

The authorization server and resource server interact with the client and requesting party in a way that is asynchronous with respect to resource owner interactions.

This lets a resource owner configure an authorization server with authorization grant rules (policy conditions) at will, rather than authorizing access token issuance synchronously just after authenticating.

For example, bank customer (resource owner) Alice with a bank account service (resource server) can use a sharing management service (authorization server) hosted by the bank to manage access to her various protected resources by spouse Bob, accounting professional Charline and financial information aggregation company Decide Account, all using different client applications.
Each of her bank accounts is a protected resource, and two different scopes of access she can control on them are viewing account data and accessing payment functions.

NOTE: link:https://docs.kantarainitiative.org/uma/wg/oauth-uma-grant-2.0-08.html#claim-redirect[The User-Managed Access (UMA) 2.0 Grant for OAuth 2.0 Authorization specification^] discusses the use of the authorization server's claims interaction endpoint for one or more interactive claims-gathering processes as the authorization server requires. AM does not support interactive claims gathering. Claims gathering is accomplished by having the requesting party acquire an OpenID Connect (OIDC) ID token.

== Using UMA 2.0

AM exposes an endpoint for discovering information about the UMA provider configuration.

* Discovery endpoint URL: `\https://am-gateway/{domain}/uma/.well-known/uma2-configuration`
* UMA 2.0 protocol endpoints exposed by AM API: link:{{ '/am/current/uma2/index.html' | relative_url }}[UMA 2.0 API Console^] - link:{% link /am/current/uma2/swagger.yml %}[Swagger spec^]

== Roles

The UMA grant flow enhances the OAuth entity definitions in order to accommodate the requesting party role.

resource owner:: An entity capable of granting access to a protected resource, the _user_ in User-Managed Access.
The resource owner may be an end user (natural person) or may be a non-human entity treated as a person for limited legal purposes (legal person), such as a corporation.
requesting party:: A natural or legal person that uses a client to seek access to a protected resource. The requesting party may or may not be the same party as the resource owner.
client:: An application that is capable of making requests for protected resources with the resource owner's authorization and on the requesting party's behalf.
resource server:: A server that hosts resources on a resource owner's behalf and is capable of accepting and responding to requests for protected resources.
authorization server:: A server that protects, on a resource owner's behalf, resources hosted on a resource server.

== Protocol flow

The UMA 2.0 flow enhances the standard OAuth 2.0 grant by defining formal communications between the UMA-enabled authorization server and resource server as they act on behalf of the resource owner.

== Endpoints

=== Resource registration endpoint

The link:https://docs.kantarainitiative.org/uma/wg/rec-oauth-uma-federated-authz-2.0.html#resource-registration-endpoint[resource registration endpoint^] enables the resource server to put resources under the protection of an authorization server on behalf of the resource owner and manage them over time.
The authorization server must first verify the identity of the resource owner.

* Resource registration endpoint URL: `\https://am-gateway/{domain}/uma/protection/resource_set`

=== Access policies endpoint

The link:https://docs.kantarainitiative.org/uma/wg/rec-oauth-uma-federated-authz-2.0.html#reg-api[access policies endpoint^] allows the resource server to redirect an end user resource owner to a specific user interface within the authorization server where the resource owner can immediately set or modify access policies subsequent to the resource registration action just completed.

* Access policies endpoint URL: `\https://am-gateway/{domain}/uma/protection/resource_set/:resourceId/policies`
* Only the resource owner can create a policy to protect a resource; administrator users cannot create policies on behalf of a resource owner

The policies can be written with the Groovy language using the link:{{ '/apim/3.x/apim_policies_groovy.html' | relative_url }}[Groovy policy^].

When the authorization server handles an incoming UMA 2 grant request, some attributes are automatically created.

* `{#request}`: current HTTP request including parameters, headers, path and so on
* `{#context.attributes['client']}`: OAuth 2.0 client including clientId, clientName and so on
* `{#context.attributes['user']}`: requesting party user including elementusername, firstName, lastName, email, roles and so on
* `{#context.attributes['permissionRequest']}`: requested permission for the given resource including resourceId and resourceScopes

The following example gives *read* access to a resource only for the requesting party *Bob*.

----
import io.gravitee.policy.groovy.PolicyResult.State

user = context.attributes['user']
permissionRequest = context.attributes['permissionRequest']

if (user.username == 'bob' && permissionRequest.resourceScopes.contains('read')) {
  result.state = State.SUCCESS;
} else {
  result.state = State.FAILURE;
}
----

=== Permission endpoint

The link:https://docs.kantarainitiative.org/uma/wg/rec-oauth-uma-federated-authz-2.0.html#permission-endpoint[permission endpoint^] defines a means for the resource server to request one or more permissions (resource identifiers and corresponding scopes) from the authorization server on the client's behalf, and to receive a permission ticket in return (for example, request party wants to access Alice documents (`GET /alice/documents/**`).

* Authorization endpoint URL: `\https://am-gateway/{domain}/uma/protection/permission`

=== Introspection endpoint

The link:https://docs.kantarainitiative.org/uma/wg/rec-oauth-uma-federated-authz-2.0.html#introspection-endpoint[introspection endpoint^] is an OAuth 2.0 endpoint that takes a parameter representing an OAuth 2.0 token and returns a JSON [RFC7159] document representing the meta information about the token, including whether this token is currently active.
The resource server uses this endpoint to determine whether the access token (RPT) is active and, if so, its associated permissions.

* Introspection endpoint URL: `\https://am-gateway/{domain}/oauth/introspect`

== Example

Let's imagine the user Alice (the resource owner) wants to share read access to her bank account with her accountant Bob (the requesting party).
The personal bank account data is exposed through an API (the resource server) secured by OAuth 2.0 protocol.

. Alice must log in to the bank application and configure access to personal data resources.
. Bob will log in and use the bank application and the bank API to access Alice's personal data.

=== Configure your security domain

To use the UMA 2.0 protocol you must enable it at security domain level.

. link:{{ '/am/current/am_userguide_authentication.html' | relative_url }}[Log in to AM Console^] as administrator of your security domain.
. Click *Settings > UMA*.
. On the UMA page, enable *User-Managed Access (UMA) 2.0 support* and click *SAVE*.

==== Create a resource owner

. Click *Settings > Users* and click the plus icon image:{% link images/icons/plus-icon.png %}[role="icon"].
. Complete the details of the resource owner (Alice) and click *CREATE*.

NOTE: The resource owner needs to use the same identity provider as the provider to be used for the resource server application.

==== Create a requesting party

. In *Settings > Users*, click the plus icon image:{% link images/icons/plus-icon.png %}[role="icon"].
. Complete the details of the requesting party (Bob) and click *CREATE*.

NOTE: The requesting party needs to use the same identity provider as the provider to be used for the client application.

==== Create the client application

. Click *Applications* and click the plus icon image:{% link images/icons/plus-icon.png %}[role="icon"].
. Select the *Web* application type and click *Next*.
. Complete the application details and click *Create*.
. Click the *Identity Providers* tab and select the identity provider you set for your requesting party user (Bob).
. Click the *Settings* tab and click *OAuth 2.0 / OIDC*.
. In the *Scopes* section, add *openid* and *read* scopes and click *SAVE*.

==== Create the resource server application

. In *Applications*, click the plus icon image:{% link images/icons/plus-icon.png %}[role="icon"].
. Select *Resource Server* as the application type and click *Next*.
. Complete the application details and click *Create*.
. Click the *Identity Providers* tab and select the identity provider you set for your resource owner (Alice).

=== Protect the resource owner resources

==== Get a Protection API Token (PAT)

The resource owner must acquire a PAT to register a resource and create authorization grant rules.
To obtain the PAT the resource owner must log in to the application using any link:{{ '/am/current/am_devguide_protocols_oauth2_overview.html#authorization_grant' | relative_url }}[OAuth 2.0 flow^].

In this example we are using the link:{{ '/am/current/am_devguide_protocols_oauth2_overview.html#resource_owner_password_credentials' | relative_url }}[Resource owner password flow^]:

  "scope": "uma_protection"
  "expires_in": 7199
}
----

[NOTE]
====
`Resource-Server-Client-ID` and `Resource-Server-Client-Secret` can be found in your resource server application settings page.

The `access_token` is the Protection API Token (PAT) that you can use to register the resources to protect.
====

==== Register resources

With the acquired PAT, the resource owner can now register a resource.

----

[NOTE]
====
The PAT Bearer Token is used via the Authorization HTTP header.
The `user_access_policy_uri` field gives you the URL to assign access policies to this resource.
====

==== Assign access policies

Now that your resource is created, you can protect and share access to it by defining some access policies.

----

[NOTE]
====
The PAT Bearer Token is used via the Authorization HTTP header.

In this example we want to share access with our requesting party Bob. See link:{{ '/am/current/am_devguide_protocols_uma2_overview.html#access_policies_endpoint' | relative_url }}[Access policies endpoint] for more information.
====

=== Request access to the resource owner resources

==== Get a Permission Ticket (PT)

When the resource server receives a request for access to a resource, it needs to request a permission ticket.
This permission ticket will be bound to a particular resource and corresponding scopes.

----
$ curl -X POST \
--header 'authorization: Bearer eyJraWQiOiJkZWZhdWx0LWdyYXZpdGVlLUFNLWtleSIsImFsZyI6IkhTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOi....' \

https://am-gateway/{domain}/uma/protection/permission

{
  "ticket": "fe594f7c-5284-4172-994f-7c5284617215"
}
----

[NOTE]
====
The PAT Bearer Token which is used via the Authorization HTTP header must be obtained by the resource server via the link:{{ '/am/current/am_devguide_protocols_oauth2_overview.html#client_credentials' | relative_url }}[OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow^].

The `ticket` property in the response is the permission ticket, which will be used to obtain the Requesting Party Token.
====

==== Get the Requesting Party Token (RPT)

In order to get an RPT, the requesting party must be authenticated, so the first step is to log in the requesting party.

In this example we are using the link:{{ '/am/current/am_devguide_protocols_oauth2_overview.html#resource_owner_password_credentials' | relative_url }}[Resource owner password flow]:

  "scope": "openid read"
  "expires_in": 7199
}
----

[NOTE]
====
`Client-Client-ID` and `Client-Client-Secret` can be found in your client application settings page.

The `id_token` will be use to prove the requesting party identity and authentication state (known as claim token).
====

The requesting party then makes a request using the permission ticket and the acquired claim token (the `id_token`) to get a Requesting Party Token (RPT).

----
$ curl -X POST \

  "expires_in": 7199
}
----

[NOTE]
====
To make the request you must use the permission `ticket` and the `claim_token` (`id_token`) acquired earlier.

The `access_token` property is the RPT.
====

==== Get the resource owner data

The client application can now use the RPT to get the resource owner personal data.

[source]
----
GET  https://api.company.com/bank/users/alice/documents
Authorization: Bearer eyJraWQiOiJkZWZhdWx0LWdyYXZpdGVlLUFNLWtleSIsImFsZyI6IkhTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOi....
----

NOTE: The RPT Bearer Token is used via the Authorization HTTP header.

The Bank API must check the incoming token to determine the active state of the access token and decide to accept or deny the request.

You can use the link:{{ '/am/current/am_devguide_protocols_oauth2_overview.html#introspection_endpoint' | relative_url }}[Introspect endpoint^] to inspect the properties of the RPT.

[source]
----

----

In this example the RPT is valid and the resource server application can check if the requesting party can access the resource using the `permissions` property.
