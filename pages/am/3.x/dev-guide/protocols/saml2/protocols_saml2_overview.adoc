== Overview

link:http://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/Post2.0/sstc-saml-tech-overview-2.0.html[The Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)] standard defines an XML-based framework for describing and exchanging security information between on-line business partners.

Gravitee.io AM supports the SAML protocol and can serve both as Identity Provider (IdP) and Service Provider (SP) :

== Participants

At a minimum, SAML exchanges take place between system entities referred to as a SAML asserting party and a SAML relying party.
In many SAML use cases, a user, perhaps running a web browser or executing a SAML-enabled application, is also a participant, and may even be the asserting party.

Service provider (SP)::
A relying party that uses assertions it has received from the Identity Provider (IdP) to grant the principal access to local resources.

Identity provider (IdP)::
Entity that authenticates users and provides to service providers (SP) an authentication assertion that indicates a principal has been authenticated.
