OAuth 2.0 defines standard grant types for token endpoints, such as _password_, _authorization_code_ and _refresh_token_.

Extension grants are a way to add support for non-standard token issuance scenarios like token exchange, delegation or
custom credentials.

AM allows you to extend available grants for an application by adding custom extension grants.
