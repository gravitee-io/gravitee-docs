== System Requirements

=== JDK

Gravitee.io AM Gateway is supporting from Java 8 to latest Java 11. Before you install Gravitee.io AM Gateway, please check your Java version :

[source,bash]
----
java -version
echo $JAVA_HOME
----

NOTE: You can download the latest OpenJDK from https://jdk.java.net/archive/[OpenJDK Download Site].

=== Repository

Default AM Gateway distribution requires MongoDB 3.x to store data.

NOTE: You can download MongoDB 3.x from the https://www.mongodb.org/downloads#production[MongoDB Download Site].

== Installing from the ZIP archive

Binaries are available from https://download.gravitee.io/graviteeio-am/components/gravitee-am-gateway/gravitee-am-gateway-standalone-{{ site.products.am.version }}.zip.

[source,bash]
[subs="attributes"]
$ curl -L https://download.gravitee.io/graviteeio-am/components/gravitee-am-gateway/gravitee-am-gateway-standalone-{{ site.products.am.version }}.zip -o gravitee-am-gateway-standalone-{{ site.products.am.version }}.zip

Once file has been downloaded, you just have to unpack it in the right place.

[source,bash]
[subs="attributes"]
$ unzip gravitee-am-gateway-standalone-{{ site.products.am.version }}.zip

== Running AM Gateway from the command line

AM Gateway can be started from the command line as follows:

[source,bash]
----
$ cd gravitee-am-gateway-standalone-{{ site.products.am.version }}
$ ./bin/gravitee
----

By default, AM Gateway runs in the foreground, prints its logs to the standard output (stdout), and can be stopped
by pressing Ctrl-C.

If everything goes well, you should see this log:

[source,bash]
[subs="attributes"]
...
11:23:06.835 [main] [] INFO  i.g.am.gateway.node.GatewayNode - Gravitee.io - Access Management - Gateway id[92c03b26-5f21-4460-803b-265f211460be] version[{{ site.products.am.version }}] pid[4528] build[${env.BUILD_NUMBER}#${env.GIT_COMMIT}] jvm[Oracle Corporation/Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM/25.121-b13] started in 1860 ms.
...

== Checking that AM Gateway is running

You can test that your AM Gateway node is running by sending an HTTP request to port `8092` on `localhost`:

[source,bash]
----
$ curl -X GET http://localhost:8092/
----

which should give you an empty 404 response (no context-path found)

== Running as a daemon

To run AM Gateway as a daemon, specify -d on the command line, and record the process ID in a file using the -p option:

[source,bash]
----
$ ./bin/gravitee -d -p=/var/run/gio.pid
----

Log messages can be found in the `$GRAVITEE_HOME/logs/` directory.

To shut down AM Gateway, kill the process ID recorded in the pid file:

[source,bash]
----
$ kill `cat /var/run/gio.pid`
----

== Directory structure

After successfully installed AM Gateway, the `graviteeio-am-gateway` directory looks like this:

[width="100%",cols="20%,80%",frame="topbot",options="header"]
