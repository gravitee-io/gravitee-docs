== Run Gravitee.io Access Management

IMPORTANT: We assume that you are familiar with Docker terms. +
To run our official images, you must start by installing https://docs.docker.com/installation/[Docker]

Gravitee.io Access Management Docker images are https://hub.docker.com/u/graviteeio/[available on Docker Hub].
You could find all https://github.com/gravitee-io/graviteeio-access-management/tree/master/docker/[Dockerfiles on GitHub].

We provide a complete set of images.

You can launch a complete environment using our ready-to-use docker-compose file. It includes Gravitee.io Access Management + MongoDB.

[source, shell]
....
# Download required Docker Compose files
$ mkdir -p config
$ curl -L -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gravitee-io/graviteeio-access-management/master/docker/compose/docker-compose.yml
$ curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gravitee-io/graviteeio-access-management/master/docker/compose/.env
$ cd config && { curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gravitee-io/graviteeio-access-management/master/docker/compose/config/nginx.conf ; cd -; }

# (Optional step: pull to ensure that you are running latest images)
$ docker-compose pull

# And run...
$ docker-compose up
....

When all components are started, you can do a quick test to see if everything is ok by checking these urls:

|===
|Image |URL

|{docker-hub}/am-gateway/[graviteeio/am-gateway]
|http://localhost/am/

|{docker-hub}/am-management-api/[graviteeio/am-management-api]
|http://localhost/am/management

|{docker-hub}/am-webui/[graviteeio/am-management-ui]
|http://localhost/am/ui/

|===

If you want to run Gravitee.io AM with a different version or if you want to want to change the default port, you can run
`docker-compose`as follow:

[source, shell]
....
$ GIO_AM_VERSION=3 NGINX_PORT=18000 docker-compose up
....

Once done, you're now ready to play with Gravitee.io Access Management, so let's take a look to the <<gravitee-quickstart, Quickstart guide>>.

=== Running AM in a single line

If you are impatient to play with Gravitee.io Access Management (something we can understand!), you can also run the following command line:

[source, shell]
....
$ curl -L http://bit.ly/graviteeio-am | bash
....

NOTE: You can change default http port (80), by passing -s <port> argument to the curl command.

[source, shell]
....
$ curl -L http://bit.ly/graviteeio-am | bash -s 8080
....

Validation steps are the same as the previous section.
