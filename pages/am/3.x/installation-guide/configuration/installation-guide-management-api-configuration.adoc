== `gravitee.yml` configuration

=== Configure HTTP server

You can update the HTTP server configuration in the following section of the `gravitee.yml` file.

[source,yaml]
----
jetty:
  port: 8093
  idleTimeout: 0
  tcpKeepAlive: true
  compressionSupported: false
  pool:
    workers: 100
  secured: false
  ssl:
    clientAuth: false
    keystore:
      path:
      password:
    truststore:
      path:
      password:
----

==== Enable HTTPS support

First, you need to provide a keystore. If you don’t have one, you can generate it:

[source,yaml]
----
keytool -genkey \
  -alias test \
  -keyalg RSA \
  -keystore server-keystore.jks \
  -keysize 2048 \
  -validity 360 \
  -dname CN=localhost \
  -keypass secret \
  -storepass secret
----

You then need to enable secure mode in your `gravitee.yml`:

[source,yaml]
----
jetty:
  port: 8093
  idleTimeout: 0
  tcpKeepAlive: true
  compressionSupported: false
  pool:
    workers: 100
  secured: true
  ssl:
    clientAuth: false
    keystore:
      path: /path/to/keystore.jks
      password: secret
    truststore:
      path:
      password:
----


=== Security

Since  AM 3.10, the security section allows you to define the users available to authenticate to the management console after the first start.
Until AM 3.9, there was only one user `admin` created in a inline identity provider. In 3.10, this behaviour is preserve by enabling the `security.defaultAdmin` option (default value).

This section introduce a providers section to define a set of identity providers instantiated on startup. These providers are not visible from the management UI.

Currently, only the provider type `memory` is available. The users known by this provider are defined into a list named `users` (see example here after).
For each user, you have to define one organization role:

* ORGANIZATION_PRIMARY_OWNER
* ORGANIZATION_OWNER
* ORGANIZATION_USER

If a user role or a user password is updated, new values are applied on restart.

[source,yaml]
----
security:
  # If true create on AM boostrap an inline identity provider with an admin user (login: admin)
  # this is the legacy mode
  defaultAdmin: true
  ## authentication providers
  ## currently, only "in memory" provider is supported
  providers:
    - type: memory
      enabled: false
      ## Name of IdentityProvider
      ## If missing the type will be used to create a generic name (ex: Memory users)
      #name:
      ## password encoding/hashing algorithm. One of:
      ## - BCrypt : passwords are hashed with bcrypt (supports only $2a$ algorithm)
      ## - none : passwords are not hashed/encrypted
      #default value is BCrypt
      password-encoding-algo: BCrypt
      users:
        - username: admin
          #email:
          firstname: Administrator
          lastname: Administrator
          ## Passwords are encoded using BCrypt
          ## Password value: adminadmin
          password: $2a$10$NG5WLbspq8V1yJDzUKfUK.oum94qL/Ne3B5fQCgekw/Y4aOEaoFZq
          role: ORGANIZATION_OWNER
----


=== Configure email

----
# SMTP configuration used to send mails
email:
  enabled: false
  host: smtp.my.domain
  subject: "[Gravitee.io] %s"
  port: 587
  from: noreply@my.domain
  username: user@my.domain
  password: password
#  properties:
#    auth: true
#    starttls.enable: true
#    ssl.trust: smtp.gmail.com
#    ssl.protocols: TLSv1.2

# Mail templates
#templates:
#  path: ${gravitee.home}/templates
----

TIP: In order to enforce TLS 1.2 uncomment the properties in the above example and change according to your requirements.


==== Email password and name complexity

You can configure the complexities as per your organizational requirements. The default settings is shown below:

----
user:
  email:
    policy:
      pattern: ^[a-zA-Z0-9_+-]+(?:\.[a-zA-Z0-9_+-]+)*@(?:[a-zA-Z0-9-]+\.)+[a-zA-Z]{2,7}$
  # Password complexity validation policy
  # Applications should enforce password complexity rules to discourage easy to guess passwords.
  # Passwords should require a minimum level of complexity that makes sense for the application and its user population.
  password:
    policy:
      # Regex pattern for password validation (default to OWASP recommendations).
      # 8 to 32 characters, no more than 2 consecutive equal characters, min 1 special characters (@ & # ...), min 1 upper case character.
      pattern: ^(?:(?=.*\d)(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[a-z])|(?=.*\d)(?=.*[^A-Za-z0-9])(?=.*[a-z])|(?=.*[^A-Za-z0-9])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[a-z])|(?=.*\d)(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[^A-Za-z0-9]))(?!.*(.)\1{2,})[A-Za-z0-9!~<>,;:_\-=?*+#."'&§`£€%°()\\\|\[\]\-\$\^\@\/]{8,32}$
        # Example : ^(?=.*[0-9])(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[@#$%^&+=])(?=\S+$).{8,}$
        # ^                # start-of-string
        #(?=.*[0-9])       # a digit must occur at least once
        #(?=.*[a-z])       # a lower case letter must occur at least once
        #(?=.*[A-Z])       # an upper case letter must occur at least once
        #(?=.*[@#$%^&+=])  # a special character must occur at least once
        #(?=\S+$)          # no whitespace allowed in the entire string
        #.{8,}             # anything, at least eight places though
        #$                 # end-of-string

      ## Password dictionary to exclude most commons passwords
      ## You need to enable the feature in the AM management console

      #dictionary:
      #  filename: /path/to/dictionary  # if null `resources/dictionaries/10k-most-common.txt` will be loaded
      #  watch: true #if true, watches periodically for any changes in the file
  name:
    strict:
      policy:
        pattern: ^[^±!@£$%^&*_+§¡€#¢¶•ªº«»\\/<>?:;|=.,]{0,100}$
    lax:
      policy:
        pattern: ^[^±!£$%^&*§¡€¢¶•ªº«»\\/<>?|=]{0,100}$
  username:
    policy:
      pattern: ^[^±!£$%^&*§¡€¢¶•ªº«»\\/<>?:;|=,]{1,100}$

=== Configure the Plugins repository

Gravitee.io Gateway <<gravitee-plugins,plugins>> directory configuration.

[source,yaml]
----
plugins:

=== Configure notifications on certificates expiry

[label label-version]#New in version 3.17#

Gravitee AM provides a notification mechanism to inform about certificates expiry. When enabled, domain primary owners and domain owners will receive a notification using the configured channel (UI or Email). These notifications will be triggered based on several conditions: 

* the frequence on which the certificates expiry dates are evaluate
* the number of days before the certificate expiry
* the number of days to wait before a notification is going to be resent

All the settings here after have to be defined into the `services` section of the `gravitee.yaml` file.

[source,yaml]
----
services:
  # platform notifier service
  notifier:
    enabled: true
    tryAvoidDuplicateNotification: false

  # Rules about certificate expiry notifications.
  # Require the platform notifier service.
  certificate:
    enabled: true
    # frequency on which the notifier mechanism will test
    # if new notifications need to be send
    # default: 0 0 5 * * * (every day at 5am)
    cronExpression: 0 0 5 * * *
    # send notification if certificate is going to expire in less than 20 days,
    # then send again the notification 15 days before the expiry, then 10...
    expiryThresholds: 20,15,10,5,1
    # Subject of the email send by the email notifier
    expiryEmailSubject: Certificate will expire soon
----

In addition of the configuration for services, the notification channels have to be defined. Currently, there are two channel :

* email: If enable, a notification will be sent by email using the smtp settings defined in this section.
* ui: If enable, a notification icon will be available on top of the console UI to inform about new notifications.

[source,yaml]
----
notifiers:
  email:
    enabled: false
    host: smtp.my.domain
    port: 587
    username: user@my.domain
    password: password
    from: noreply@my.domain
    startTLSEnabled: false
    sslTrustAll: false
    #sslKeyStore: /path/to/keystore
    #sslKeyStorePassword: changeme
  ui:
    enabled: true

== Configure load balancing

If you are planning to use multiple instances, you need to implement sticky sessions in your load balancer, until https://github.com/gravitee-io/issues/issues/2523[this issue] is closed.

=== Apache

Example using three instances of AM API. We add an additional cookie named ROUTEID.
TLS termination is configured in Apache, so we just use HTTP.

----
<Proxy balancer://amm_hcluster>
        BalancerMember http://GRAVITEEIO-AM-MGT-API-HOST1:8093 route=apim1-test
        BalancerMember http://GRAVITEEIO-AM-MGT-API-HOST2:8093 route=apim2-test
        BalancerMember http://GRAVITEEIO-AM-MGT-API-HOST3:8093 route=apim3-test
        ProxySet stickysession=ROUTEID
        ProxySet lbmethod=byrequests
        Header add Set-Cookie "ROUTEID=.%{BALANCER_WORKER_ROUTE}e;" env=BALANCER_ROUTE_CHANGED
        Header append Via %{BALANCER_WORKER_ROUTE}e
</Proxy>
----

Then, in your VirtualHost configuration we declare the paths we want to proxy:

----
# Management Realm
ProxyPass /admin balancer://amm_hcluster/admin
ProxyPassReverse /admin balancer://amm_hcluster/admin

# Management
ProxyPass /management balancer://amm_hcluster/management
ProxyPassReverse /management balancer://amm_hcluster/management
----
