As described in the link:/am/current/am_overview_architecture.html[architecture overview] page, Gravitee.io
Access Management (AM) is split into three main components:

* link:/am/current/am_installguide_gateway_install_zip.html[AM Gateway]
* link:/am/current/am_installguide_management_api_install_zip.html[AM API]
* link:/am/current/am_installguide_management_ui_install_zip.html[AM Console]

The following sections explain how to prepare, install and configure your AM environment.

NOTE: This Installation Guide provides information about how to install Gravitee.io components. For external components, such as
MongoDB, see the relevant product documentation.
