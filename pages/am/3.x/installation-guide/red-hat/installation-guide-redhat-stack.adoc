== Overview

This section describes how-to install the full AM stack, including all the components and, optionally, dependencies.

If you want to install AM components individually, see the following sections:

* link:{{ '/am/current/am_installguide_amazon_gateway.html' | relative_url }}[Install AM Gateway]
* link:{{ '/am/current/am_installguide_amazon_management_api.html' | relative_url }}[Install AM API]
* link:{{ '/am/current/am_installguide_amazon_management_ui.html' | relative_url }}[Install AM Console]

== Prerequisites

Before you install the AM stack, you must complete the following configuration.

=== Install Nginx

To install Nginx, run the following commands:

[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
sudo yum install epel-release
sudo yum install nginx
----

=== Configure the package management system

Ensure you have configured your package management system, as described in link:{{ '/am/current/am_installguide_redhat_introduction.html#configure-the-package-management-system-yum' | relative_url }}[Configure the package management system (yum)^].

== Install the AM package (no dependencies)

To install the AM package only, run the following command:

[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
sudo yum install {gravitee-package-name}
----

== Install the AM package with dependencies

=== Configure dependency repositories

Before you install the AM package, you may need to add third-party repositories.

==== MongoDB

NOTE: For guidance on installing and configuring MongoDB, see the link:https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v7.0/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-red-hat/[MongoDB Installation documentation, window=\"_blank\"].

[source,bash]
----
echo "[mongodb-org-7.0]
name=MongoDB Repository
baseurl=https://repo.mongodb.org/yum/redhat/\$releasever/mongodb-org/7.0/x86_64/
gpgcheck=1
enabled=1
gpgkey=https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-7.0.asc" | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/mongodb-org-7.0.repo > /dev/null

sudo yum install -y mongodb-org
sudo systemctl start mongod

=== Upgrade AM

As of AM 3.20.16 and 3.21.10, to upgrade an AM component you can simply do a `yum upgrade` and restart AM:

WARNING: Always look at the changelog to follow potential breaking changes.

[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
sudo yum upgrade -y {gravitee-package-name}
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart {gravitee-package-name}-gateway {gravitee-package-name}-management-api nginx
----


== Run AM with `systemd`

To start up the AM components, run the following commands:

[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start {gravitee-package-name}-gateway {gravitee-package-name}-management-api
sudo systemctl restart nginx

== Check the AM components are running

When all components are started, you can do a quick test to see if everything is ok by checking these URLs:

|===
|Component |URL

|AM Gateway
|http://localhost:8092

|AM API
|http://localhost:8093

|AM Console
|http://localhost:8094
