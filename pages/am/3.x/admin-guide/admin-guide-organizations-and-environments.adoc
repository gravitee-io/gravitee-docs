== Overview

In preparation for the upcoming Cockpit product offering (see link:https://www.gravitee.io/products/roadmap[Roadmap > Cockpit]), we have introduced two concepts:

== Environment
An _environment_ is a logical workspace in which users can manage their security domains and applications with underlying configuration and auditing capabilities . +

Some examples of environments you can define are:

* technical environments, such as DEV / TEST / PRODUCTION
* functional environments, such as PRIVATE DOMAINS / PUBLIC DOMAINS / PARTNERSHIP

An environment belongs to one organization.

== Organization
An _organization_ allows users to customize AM to their own internal organization. It can manage multiple environments by sharing configurations like:

* Users allows to access the AM Console
* Roles
* Identity providers to access the AM Console

NOTE: By default, the OSS version of AM comes with a default organization and a default environment. For a multi-environment setup, you need an integration with link:https://www.gravitee.io/products/cockpit[Cockpit].
