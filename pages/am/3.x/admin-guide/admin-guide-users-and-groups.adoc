== Users

When users log in to AM Console, they are listed in the *Users* section of the *Global settings* menu.

If you select a user, you have access to detailed account information and will be able to manage the user's permissions and groups via with the *Administrative roles* and *Groups* sections.

== Groups

Groups represent user groups where you place members of the same team/partner and set their roles for an APPLICATION (see link:{{ '/am/current/am_adminguide_roles_and_permissions.html' | relative_url }}[Roles and permissions^] for details).
You can associate a group with an application to give members of the group have access to the application.

In the example below, we will create a `FOO Team` group where you can put all members of your FOO team.

== Create the `FOO Team` group

. link:{{ '/am/current/am_userguide_authentication.html' | relative_url }}[Log in to AM Console^].
. From the user menu at the top right, select *Global settings*.
. Click *Settings > Groups*.
. Click the plus icon image:{% link images/icons/plus-icon.png %}[role="icon"].
. Enter the details of the group.
+

. Click *CREATE*.

== Configure group members

. Click the settings icon image:{% link images/icons/settings-icon.png %}[role="icon"] next to the `FOO Team` group.
. Click the *Members* tab.
. Add a user by clicking *+ Add members*.
+

== Add the group to an application

Go to the Application you want to modify and click *Administrative roles*.

image::{% link images/am/current/graviteeio-am-adminguide-application-group-members.png %}[]

Now the members of the group section will have access to the Application with the group role permissions.

NOTE: Direct user member permissions and group permissions are merged they apply to the same user.
