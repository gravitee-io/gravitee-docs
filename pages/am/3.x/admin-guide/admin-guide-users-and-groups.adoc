== Users

When users authenticate to the portal they are listed in the `Users` section of the `Global Settings` menu.

If you select a user, you have access to a detailed information about its account and will be able to manage its permissions and groups via the `Administrative roles` and `Groups` section.

== Groups

Groups represent users groups where you put members of the same team/partner and set their roles for an APPLICATION (see link:/am/current/am_adminguide_roles_and_permissions.html[Roles and Permissions] for details).
Once a group is created, you can associate it to an application and members of this group will have access to this Application.

Let use groups to create a `FOO Team` group where you can put all members of your FOO team.

=== How to manage groups
==== Create the `FOO Team` group

. Go to the `Global Settings -> Groups` section
. Click `(+)` button, fill out the form and press `CREATE`

. Go to `Members` tab and add a user by clicking on the `+ Add members` button.

==== Add the group to an application

Go to the Application you want to modify and select the `Administrative roles` section.

Now the members of the group section will have access to the Application with the group role permissions.

NOTE: Direct user member permissions and group permissions are merged if it concerns the same user.
