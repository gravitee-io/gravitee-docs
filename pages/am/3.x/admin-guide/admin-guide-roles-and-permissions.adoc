Gravitee.io AM allows you to create `Administrator roles` that can be used to grant access to specific areas of a resource (Organization (Platform), Security Domain, Application).
Depending of the role permissions, administrators can have full access to this resource. Administrator accounts represent users that can access to the administration portal.

== Glossary
=== Assignable type

When you log in Gravitee.io AM, you are redirected to the portal with at least one `ORGANIZATION` role to be able to see some screens of the platform.

As a owner of a security domain or an application you want to manage your members by giving them roles that make sense only when it is associated with a `DOMAIN` / `APPLICATION`.

For example you don't want to allow a simple user or the person in charge of your application settings to be able to manage the whole platform.

In order to limit the scope of the roles, scopes are bound to what we call an `Assignable type` :

- ORGANIZATION -> role for the whole platform
- DOMAIN -> role for a security domain
- APPLICATION -> role for an application

=== Role
A role is a functional group of permissions.
There is no limit on the number of roles you're allowed to create.

Some roles are specials. The are tagged as `System` or `Default`.

==== System Role
A System Role is a read-only role (i.e. you cannot change permissions) needs by Gravitee.io AM. For example `ORGANIZATION_PRIMARY_OWNER` give user all permissions.

==== Default Role
A Default Role is a role used by Gravitee.io AM when a role is not specified.
For example, the default `ORGANIZATION_USER` role is set to a new registered user.

=== Permissions
A permission is a list of actions allowed on a resource. The actions are `Create`, `Read`, `List`, `Update` and `Delete`.
Some permissions can be assigned to multiple kind of resources. For instance, the DOMAIN READ permission has different meaning whether it is assigned:

- to a domain: means the user can read the specified domain
- to an organization: means the user can read all the domains of the specified organization

Here is the list of permissions by assignable type.

NOTE: All the permissions required to use the AM Management API are described in the link:/am/current/management-api/index.html[AM V3 OpenAPI descriptor].
