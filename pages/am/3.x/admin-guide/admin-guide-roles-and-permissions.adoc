== Overview

You can create administrator roles in AM to grant access to specific areas of a resource (Organization (Platform), Security Domain, Application).
Depending on the role permissions, administrators can have full access to this resource. Administrator accounts represent users that can access the administration portal.

=== Assignable type

When you log in AM, you are redirected to the portal with at least one `ORGANIZATION` role to be able to see some screens of the platform.

As an owner of a security domain or an application you want to manage your members by giving them roles that make sense only when associated with a `DOMAIN` / `APPLICATION`.

For example, you don't want to allow a simple user or the person in charge of your application settings to be able to manage the whole platform.

In order to limit the scope of the roles, scopes are bound to what we call an `assignable type`:

- `ORGANIZATION` -- role for the whole platform
- `ENVIRONMENT` -- role for an environment
- `DOMAIN` -- role for a security domain
- `APPLICATION` -- role for an application

=== Role
A role is a functional group of permissions.
There is no limit on the number of roles you are allowed to create.

Some roles are special: they are tagged as `System` or `Default`.

==== System role
A System role is a read-only role (i.e. you cannot change its permissions) used by AM. For example `ORGANIZATION_PRIMARY_OWNER` gives the user all permissions.

==== Default role
A Default role is a role used by AM when a role is not specified.
For example, new registered users are assigned the default `ORGANIZATION_USER` role.

=== Permission
A permission is a list of actions allowed on a resource. The actions are `Create`, `Read`, `List`, `Update` and `Delete`.
Some permissions can be assigned to multiple types of resources. For instance, the `DOMAIN READ` permission has a different meaning depending on whether it is assigned:

- to a domain: the user can read the specified domain
- to an organization: the user can read all the domains of the specified organization

The following tables list the permissions by assignable type.

NOTE: All the permissions required to use AM API are described in the link:{{ '/am/current/management-api/index.html' | relative_url }}[AM V3 OpenAPI descriptor^].

== Manage roles

To manage roles and permissions:

. link:{{ '/am/current/am_userguide_authentication.html' | relative_url }}[Log in to AM Console^].
. From the user menu at the top right, select *Global settings*.
. Click *Settings > Roles*, then create a role as described in the examples below.

=== Create the `REVIEWER_APPLICATION` role
Let's imagine we want to create a reviewer role, which allows a user to check if your application configuration is valid.

. Click the plus icon image:{% link images/icons/plus-icon.png %}[role="icon"] and enter the following values:

- Assignable type : `APPLICATION`
- Name : `REVIEWER_APPLICATION`
- Description : `Read-only role`
+
image::{% link images/am/current/graviteeio-am-adminguide-new-role.png %}[]

. Click *CREATE*.

=== Configure the `REVIEWER_APPLICATION` role
You must give `READ` permissions to all sections of your application.
This allows the user to see the whole configuration of your application.

Click *SAVE* to store the changes.

.Configure
image::{% link images/am/current/graviteeio-am-adminguide-role-configure.png %}[]

=== Result

Go to your application *Administrative roles* settings section and add a new member with the `REVIEWER_APPLICATION` role. The user `Reviewer User` now has read access to your application.
