== Versions

When you subscribe to support services provided by Gravitee.io, you need to choose between two types:

* STS for Short-Term Support
* LTS for Long-Term Support

LTS applies to versions ending with 0 or 5, for example: 1.25, 1.30, 1.35
STS applies to all non-LTS versions.

An LTS version is supported for around 1 year, whereas a STS version is supported for 3 months.

When moving to an Enterprise version, this is not the case: all the LTS versions are de-facto Enterprise versions.

What does this mean for you? Nothing really, just that you can be sure that you are running the most well-tested and production-ready versions.
