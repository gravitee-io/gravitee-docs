Gravitee's open source roots are what make us great - we own our entire stack, and we believe that our code powers the best open source API Management and API Access Management products on the market.

The Community Edition (CE) of the Gravitee API Management platform is built on these open source foundations.

The Enterprise Edition (EE) of the platform builds on top of that to enable organizations to fully manage, secure, monitor, and govern their entire API ecosystem. The EE includes everything from the CE, and offers additional features that bring many new benefits and exciting capabilities to help you enable effortless control over every aspect of your organization's API ecosystem.

The capability matrix below outlines the differences between the CE and the EE in order to help clients to make the most educated buying decision.

== Community Edition vs Enterprise Edition - capability matrix

The Gravitee Enterprise Edition includes everything from the Community Edition plus additional modules, plugins, capabilities, and unlocked use options, as indicated below.
