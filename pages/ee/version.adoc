== Support policy model

=== From version 3.18.0 and above: 12-month support model for all minor versions

As of version 3.18.0 (released on 7th July 2022), we have changed the model of support we provide for released versions of the Gravitee Platform.

We now provide 12 months of support for each minor version. A minor version is considered a quarterly release version with a second-digit increment in the version cadence, for example 3.18.x (but not 3.18.1 - this is a maintenance release version).

We no longer support STS and LTS versions (see the next section for more information).

=== Prior to version 3.18.0: STS & LTS support model

Prior to the release of version 3.18.0, when you subscribed to support services provided by Gravitee.io, you could choose between two support options:

. Short-Term Support (STS).
. Long-Term Support (LTS).

LTS applied to versions ending with 0 or 5 (for example: 1.25, 1.30, 1.35).
STS applied to all non-LTS versions.

An LTS version was supported for around 1 year, whereas a STS version was supported for 3 months.

When moving to an enterprise version, this was not the case: **all** LTS versions were considered to be enterprise versions.

This model aimed to ensure that our customers would be running the most well-tested and production-ready versions.

== Supported product versions and EOL dates

The tables below provide information about product versions and their release and EOL (end of life) dates, as well as the support model used for each.

Note that the Table 1 and Table 2 reflect the entire Gravitee platform whereas Table 3 and Table 4 show breakdowns for individual products - API Management (APIM) and Access Management (AM).
