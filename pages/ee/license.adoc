To run a Gravitee Enterprise Edition (EE) node, you must have a valid license file.

== Getting an EE license

To get an EE license, email contact@graviteesource.com requesting a license.

== Applying an EE license

You can provide the EE license data for a Gravitee EE product in two ways:

1. Using an environmental variable.
2. Using a file.

It is possible to add an EE license in Kubernetes by using any of these two approaches to provide the license information.

=== Applying an EE license using an environment variable

Provide the content of the license file directly in `Base64` format using an environmental variable called "license.key":

1. Create a new secret from your Gravitee license data.
2. Update your deployment description and provide a new ENV with the license data from a Kubernetes secret, as shown in the example below.

....
spec:
  containers:
  - name: ONE_OF_GRAVITEE_EE_PRODUCTS
    image: GRAVITEE_IMAGE
    env:
    - name: license.key
      valueFrom:
        secretKeyRef:
          name: graviteeio-license
          key: license.key
          optional: false # same as default; "mysecret" must exist
....

For more information, see the link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/define-environment-variable-container[Kubernetes documentation^].

=== Applying an EE license using a file

Gravitee looks for the EE license file inside the `GRAVITEE_HOME/license/license.key` folder by default. You can override this by using another property called `gravitee.license`.

How it works:

1. Gravitee will first look for the `license.key` environmental variable.
2. If it cannot find it, Gravitee will look into the `gravitee.license` property.
3. If the `gravitee.license` property is not set, Gravitee will try to retrieve the key from the `GRAVITEE_HOME` folder.

==== Using Kubernetes

Kubernetes allows you to mount the content of a special link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/[Secret^] inside your pod. You can use this solution to provide the EE license file to Gravitee.

To do so:

1. Create a `Secret` containing the EE license data. Make sure to name the key "license.key".
2. Mount this content into your pod using `Volumes`. Note that the `mountPath` is not unique and is different for each product, as follows:
+
--
AM:

* Gateway: `/opt/graviteeio-am-gateway/license`
* API: `/opt/graviteeio-am-management-api/license`

APIM:

* Gateway: `/opt/graviteeio-gateway/license`
* API: `/opt/graviteeio-management-api/license`

AE:

* `/opt/graviteeio-alert-engine/license`
--

For example:

....
spec:
  containers:

# ...

    volumeMounts:
    - name: graviteeio-license
      mountPath: "/opt/graviteeio-am-management-api/license"
      readOnly: true
  volumes:
  - name: graviteeio-license
    secret:
      secretName: graviteeio-license
      optional: false # default setting; "mysecret" must exist
....

==== Using Helm

You can use the solutions described above if you want to modify existing resources that have already been deployed in the cluster. Alternatively, you can also provide the license information using link:https://helm.sh[Helm^] and when installing or updating existing installations.

The example below shows the contents of a simple `values.yaml` file that you can use to provide the EE license data using Helm.

....

api:

# ...

    env:
    - name: gravitee_services_notifier_enabled
      value: "true"
# ...

    extraVolumeMounts: |
      - name: graviteeio-license
        mountPath: /opt/graviteeio-am-management-api/license
        readOnly: true
        extraVolumes: |
      - name: graviteeio-license
        secret:
          secretName: graviteeio-license

gateway:

# ...

    env:
    - name: GIO_MIN_MEM
      value: 256m

# ...

    extraVolumeMounts: |
      - name: graviteeio-license
        mountPath: /opt/graviteeio-am-gateway/license
        readOnly: true
        extraVolumes: |
      - name: graviteeio-license
        secret:
          secretName: graviteeio-license
....


== My license is ending

Thirty days before the end of the license, a daily `WARN` log is printed in the log file of the node to inform you that the license is ending.

To keep the nodes running, you must provide an updated license file. This file will be reloaded silently by the node.

== License support

When running an enterprise node, a license file must be supplied to bootstrap the node.

When running the node within Docker, the license file must be passed with a volume as follows:

[source,shell]
....
$ docker run  \
        -v license.key:/opt/graviteeio-gateway/license \
        --name api-gateway  \
        --detach  \
        graviteeio/apim-gateway:{{ site.products.apim.ee.version }}-ee
....
