This section explains how to expose metrics to Prometheus.

== Enable the metrics service

You enable the metrics service in the `gravitee.yml` configuration file.
Prometheus support is activated and exposed using the component's internal API.

[source,yaml]
----
services:
  metrics:
    enabled: true
    prometheus:
      enabled: true
----

WARNING: By default, the internal component API is bound to `localhost` only, so it must not be invoked outside `localhost`.
If you need to expose the API more widely, you may need to set the `services.core.http.host` property to the correct network interface.
If you are running the application in a Docker container, set the IP to the IP address of the container.
Each change requires a restart.

== Configure labels
Labels are used to provide dimensionality to a metric. For instance, metrics related to a http request have a `http_path` label, which allows then to query timeseries for a specific path, or any other operation on timeseries.

You can specify which labels you want in the configuration file:
[source,yaml]
----
services:
  metrics:
    enabled: true
    labels:
      - local
      - remote
      - http_method
      - http_code
      - http_path
    prometheus:
      enabled: true
----

The list of available labels can be found here: https://vertx.io/docs/apidocs/io/vertx/micrometer/Label.html[Label]

WARNING: Enabling labels may result in a high cardinality in values, which can cause issues on the metrics backend (i.e. the gateway) and affect performance. +
So it must be used with care. +
In general, it is fine to enable labels when the set of possible values is bounded.

Default values are `local`, `http_method` and `http_code`.

Starting from APIM 3.10, the metrics labels have been renamed.
We have introduced a new field in prometheus configuration where you can configure it to use old Vert.X 3 label names.
Set it to 3.10, to use old labels.

[source,yaml]
----
services:
  metrics:
    prometheus:
      naming:
        version: 3.10
----

== Prometheus configuration

The following example requests Prometheus scrape the formatted metrics available in the Gateway internal API.

[source,yaml]
----
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'gio-gw'
    basic_auth:
      username: admin
      password: adminadmin
    metrics_path: /_node/metrics/prometheus
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:18082']
----

== Prometheus UI

By default when running Prometheus, the UI is exposed at \http://localhost:9090/graph

.Show `http_client_connections` metrics

The following example shows the memory consumed by the Gateway instance:

.Show `jvm_memory_used_bytes` metrics
