This section explains how to expose metrics to Prometheus.

== Enable the metrics service

You enable the metrics service in the `gravitee.yml` configuration file.
Prometheus support is activated and exposed using the component's internal API.

[source,yaml]
----
services:
  metrics:
    enabled: true
    prometheus:
      enabled: true
----

WARNING: By default, the internal component API is bound to `localhost` only, so it must not be invoked outside `localhost`.
If you need to expose the API more widely, you may need to set the `services.core.http.host` property to the correct network interface.
If you are running APIM in a Docker container, set the IP to the IP address of the container.
Each change requires a restart.

== Prometheus configuration

The following example requests Prometheus scrape the formatted metrics available in the APIM Gateway internal API.

[source,yaml]
----
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'gio-gw'
    basic_auth:
      username: admin
      password: adminadmin
    metrics_path: /_node/metrics/prometheus
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:18082']
----

== Prometheus UI

By default when running Prometheus, the UI is exposed at \http://localhost:9090/graph

.Show `http_client_connections` metrics

The following example shows the memory consumed by the APIM Gateway instance:

.Show `jvm_memory_used_bytes` metrics
