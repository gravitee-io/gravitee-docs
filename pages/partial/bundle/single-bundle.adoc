[IMPORTANT]
====
Version 3.18.0 of the Gravitee platform has introduced a unified, single distribution bundle for all features available in the Community Edition (CE) and the Enterprise Edition (EE) of Gravitee.io {gravitee-product-name}, which used to be distributed as separate bundles. This change allows for a smooth transition from CE to EE functionality, and enables you to trial EE features without the need for a migration or a standalone EE installation.

If you are a Community user and you want to try out Enterprise Edition features, just install the unified bundle, request a license, add it to the installation, and restart. You no longer need to download a new EE version of {gravitee-product-name} !
