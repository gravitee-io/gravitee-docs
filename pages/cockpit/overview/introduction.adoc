== Overview

Gravitee Cockpit is a centralized, multi-environment tool for managing all your Gravitee API Management and Access Management installations in a single place.

== Cockpit hierarchy

Cockpit is based on a hierarchy of the following entity types:

* *Account*: at the top level, your company. One user can have multiple accounts.
* *Organization*: at the second level, a logical part of your company in the way that makes most sense in your particular setup, for example a region or business unit. There can be multiple organizations linked to one account.
* *Environment*: at the third level, an environment in an IT infrastructure, such as development or production. There can be multiple environments linked to one organization.
* *Installation*: APIM or AM installations, linked to environments in Cockpit.
* *Node*: each linked installation automatically reports its REST API and Gateway nodes to Cockpit.

=== Entity properties

Each entity managed in Cockpit has some common properties:

* ID: an internal ID that is never shown in the Cockpit UI, but that you can find if you look at the API responses.
* HRID: a human readable ID of the entity. This ID is unique (no two environments in the same organization can have the same HRID), and they are used to provide readable URLs.
* Name: the name of the entity.
* Description: a description of the entity.

== Nodes

APIM and AM installations report on one or more instances of the following node types to Cockpit:

- REST API nodes
- Gateway nodes

The Cockpit hierarchy pictured below has the following setup:

- One APIM installation, with two Gateway nodes and one REST API node.
- One AM installation, with one Gateway node and one REST API node.

The organization and environment entities defined in Cockpit are equivalent to the same entities in APIM and AM, including the roles you can define for them (for example, the `ORGNIZATION_OWNER` role exists in both APIM and AM).
All nodes can belong to multiple environments, but only the Gateway node organization and environments are configurable in APIM and AM.
