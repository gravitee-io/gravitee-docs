== Overview

Gravitee Cockpit is a centralized, multi-environment tool for managing all your Gravitee API Management and Access Management installations in a single place.

== Cockpit hierarchy

Cockpit is based on a hierarchy of three entity types:

* *Account*: at the top level, your company. There is only one account.
* *Organization*: at the second level, a logical part of your company in the way that makes most sense in your particular setup, for example a region or business unit. There can be multiple organizations.
* *Environment*: at the third level, an environment in an IT infrastructure, such as development or production. There can be multiple environments.

You link your APIM or AM installations at the environment level in Cockpit. Each registered installation will then automatically report its _nodes_ to Cockpit (`management-api` and `gateway` nodes).

The Cockpit hierarchy is represented visually in Cockpit in the hierarchy map pictured at the top of the page.

NOTE: The organization and environment entities defined in Cockpit are equivalent to the same entities in APIM and AM, including the roles you can define for them (for example, the `ORGNIZATION_OWNER` role exists in both APIM and AM). For more information, see the APIM and AM product documentation.

== Cockpit entities

Each entity managed in Cockpit has some common properties:

* ID: an internal ID that is never shown in the Cockpit UI, but that you can find if you look at the API responses.
* HRID: a human readable ID of the entity. This ID is unique (no two environments in the same organization can have the same HRID), and they are used to provide readable URLs.
* Name: the name of the entity.
* Description: a description of the entity.
