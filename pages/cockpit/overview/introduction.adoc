== Overview

Gravitee Cockpit is a centralized, multi-environment tool for managing all your Gravitee API Management and Access Management installations in one handy, interactive dashboard.

== Cockpit hierarchy

Cockpit is based on a hierarchy of three entity types:

* The top level is an _account_ (corresponding to a company)
* The next level is an _organization_ (corresponding to a logical part of the company in the particular company context, such as a region or business unit)
* The lowest level is an _environment_ (corresponding to an environment in an IT infrastructure, such as a development or production environment)

You can link your APIM or AM installations at the environment level in Cockpit. This hierarchy is represented in Cockpit by a visual map on the dashboard.

NOTE: The organization and environment entities defined in Cockpit are equivalent to the same entities in APIM and AM, including the roles you can define for them (for example, the `ORGNIZATION_OWNER` role exists in both APIM and AM). For more information, see the APIM and AM product documentation.

//How is organization entity correspondence established if installations only link at environment level?
