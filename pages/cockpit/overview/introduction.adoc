== Overview

Gravitee Cockpit is a centralized, multi-environment tool for managing all your Gravitee API Management and Access Management installations in one handy, interactive dashboard.

== Cockpit hierarchy

Cockpit is based on a hierarchy of three entity types:

* The top level is an _account_ (corresponding to a company)
* The next level is an _organization_ (corresponding to a logical part of the company in the specific company context, such as a region or business unit)
* The lowest level is an _environment_ (corresponding to an environment in an IT infrastructure, such as a development or production environment)

You can link your APIM or AM installations at the environment level in Cockpit. Each registered installation will then automatically report its _nodes_ to Cockpit (a node being either a management-api node or a gateway node).

This hierarchy is represented in Cockpit by a visual map on the dashboard.

NOTE: The organization and environment entities defined in Cockpit are equivalent to the same entities in APIM and AM, including the roles you can define for them (for example, the `ORGNIZATION_OWNER` role exists in both APIM and AM). For more information, see the APIM and AM product documentation.

== Cockpit entities

Each entity managed in Cockpit has some common properties:

* ID: a technical ID that is never shown in the Cockpit UI, but that you can find if you look at the API responses.
* HRID: a human readable ID of the entity. This ID is unique (no two environments in the same organization can have the same HRID), and they are used to provide readable URLs.
* Name: the name of the entity.
* Description: a description of the entity.

Each entity provides a page to update the settings. You can access it by clicking on the settings icon image:icons/cockpit-settings-icon.png[role="icon"] of each element.
