== Cockpit hierarchy

Cockpit is based on a hierarchy of the following entity types:

|===
|Entity | Description | Additional information

|Account
|The top level entity, your company. One user can have multiple accounts.
|

|Organization
|A logical part of your company in the way that makes most sense in your setup, for example a region or business unit. There can be multiple organizations linked to one account.
.2+|The organization and environment entities defined in Cockpit are equivalent to the same entities in APIM and AM, including the roles you can define for them (for example, the `ORGNIZATION_OWNER` role exists in both APIM and AM).

Learn more about organizations and environments in link:{{ '/apim/3.x/apim_adminguide_organizations_and_environments.html' | relative_url }}[APIM^] and link:{{ '/am/current/am_adminguide_organizations_and_environments.html' | relative_url }}[AM^].

|Environment
|An environment in an IT infrastructure, such as development or production. There can be multiple environments linked to one organization.

|Installation

Node
|APIM and AM installations, linked to environments in Cockpit.
Each linked APIM and AM installation automatically reports its REST API and Gateway nodes to Cockpit.
|Nodes can belong to multiple environments. You can configure the organizations and environments associated with Gateway nodes in APIM and AM, by updating the Gateway configuration files.

Only Gateway nodes are configurable in this way, not REST API nodes.

Learn more about updating a Gateway configuration in the `gravitee.yml` file in link:{{ '/apim/3.x/apim_installguide_gateway_configuration.html' | relative_url }}[APIM^] and link:{{ '/am/current/am_installguide_gateway_configuration.html' | relative_url }}[AM^].
|===

Each entity managed in Cockpit has some common properties:

* ID: an internal ID that is never shown in the Cockpit UI, but that you can find if you look at the API responses.
* HRID: a human readable ID of the entity. This ID is unique (no two environments in the same organization can have the same HRID), and they are used to provide readable URLs.
* Name: the name of the entity.
* Description: a description of the entity.

== Example hierarchy

The Cockpit hierarchy pictured below has the following setup:

- One APIM installation, with two Gateway nodes and one REST API node.
- One AM installation, with one Gateway node and one REST API node.
