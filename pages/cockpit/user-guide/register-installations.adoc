== Overview

Existing on-premise installations of APIM and AM can be registered in Cockpit. This will allow users to create and propagate new organizations and environments to these existing installations.

A registered installation communicates with Cockpit via a WebSocket connection, secured with TLS.

== How to register a new installation

To register new APIM or AM installations with Cockpit, you need to:

* Have a Cockpit connector in your installation plugins
* Download the certificate to allow secure connection

The following steps give an overview of registering a new installation.

. Register the new installation by following the registration instructions in the *How to register a new installation* link, below *Installations* in the dashboard.
+
After registration, the installation is displayed as a pending installation in Cockpit:

. Accept the installation by clicking it, selecting the environment to which to link the installation and clicking *ACCEPT*.

The installation is added to the map with a link to the environment:

. You can then link the accepted installation to other environments in Cockpit from the link:/cockpit/1.x/cockpit_userguide_manage_environments.html[environment settings^] page.

You are redirected to the Console login page of the APIM or AM instance. If multiple APIM or AM instances are linked, the Console login page of the first instance linked to the environment opens.

== Delete an installation

WARNING: Never delete an installation unless you are sure you want to permanently remove it from Cockpit. Deleting installations permanently closes the WebSocket link between Cockpit and the installation. It cannot be reopened, even by restarting the installation. 

. Click the installation details icon.
. Click *DELETE THIS INSTALLATION*.
