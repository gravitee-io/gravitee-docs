== Overview

Existing on-premise installations of APIM and AM can be registered in Cockpit. This allows users to create and propagate new organizations and environments to these existing installations.

A registered installation communicates with Cockpit via a WebSocket connection, secured with TLS.

When you register a new installation, its REST API and Gateway nodes are automatically linked to Cockpit, including any nodes you add to your APIM and AM installations later on.

== How to register a new installation

To register new APIM or AM installations with Cockpit, you need to:

* Have a Cockpit connector in your installation plugins.
* Download the certificate to allow secure connection via Cockpit UI.
* Install the certificate, and restart your installation.

These steps are explained in detail when you register the installation.

=== Register the installation

Register the installation using the detailed instructions in the *How to register a new installation* link, below *Installations* in the dashboard.
After registration, the installation is displayed as a pending installation in Cockpit:

.. Click *ACCEPT*.

== Log in to an installation

There are two ways to log in to an installation in Cockpit:

- Click the login icon image:{% link images/icons/cockpit-login-icon.png %}[role="icon"] on the installation in the hierarchy map
- Click *LOGIN* on the environment settings page of the linked environment:

image::{% link images/cockpit/linked-installations-login.png %}[]

You are redirected to the Console login page of the APIM or AM instance.

NOTE: If multiple APIM or AM installations are linked, the Console login page of the first installation linked to the environment opens.
