== Overview
The *Gravitee.io API Designer*, part of the *Gravitee.io Cockpit*, is a graphical no-code tool for creating APIs. Using the https://www.gravitee.io/blog/why-design-first-when-building-apis[Design First] approach you can produce fully https://swagger.io/specification/[OpenAPI] compliant APIs in minutes.

When you're happy with your design, you can export it as an OpenAPI Specification (OAS) or push it to one of your linked *Gravitee.io API Management* installations.

From a business perspective, the *Gravitee.io API Designer*:

* Allows you to focus on the future needs of your customers rather than on the technical aspects
* Empowers business users to design the APIs they own
* Embraces the quick feedback loop to improve the quality of your APIs
