This is the core part of the API Designer because this is where you ... design APIs!

image::{% link images/cockpit/apid_design_default.png %}[Mindmap]

You start out with some defaults in an intuitive mindmap-like interface and add details as needed for your API.

Three elements are visible:

root:: The starting point of your design that holds the settings. You can add resources to it using the (+) buttons branching away to left or right (whatever your visual preference is).
resource:: The anchorpoints of your API, they are a conceptual mapping to a set of entities.
attribute:: The data carriers of your API.

Each element can be expanded (+). If you want to remove an element, right-click it and select delete.

NOTE: If you delete an element, all underlying elements will also be deleted.

You can distinguish between three phases. <<define,*Define*>>, <<expose,*Expose*>> and <<refine,*Refine*>>. First you *define* your attributes and resources with broad brushstrokes. How you *expose* them depends on your use case. Last but not least you *refine* the attributes.


== Define[[define]]
The key part of a *resource* definition is the name as that will show up in the request path.

For the *attribute* definition what matters mostly is the datatype. It can be an *Integer*, *Number*, *String*, *Boolean* or a list of one of these.

Both *resources* and *attributes* can be exposed in the API's documentation.

== Expose[[expose]]
For a *resource* you can specify which <<operations,operations>> are allowed on it. You can also specify whether or not the resource is searchable with query parameters.

For an *attribute* you can

* Determine its visibility in requests and responses
* Add it as a filter and/or result of searches
+
NOTE: An attribute can only be added if the parent resource or attribute is added.

An *attribute* can be expanded. This will automatically change its type to *Object*. If you want to turn it into a *resource*, it has to be a list.

== Refine[[refine]]

For an *attribute* you can

* Provide an example value which will be used in mock responses
* Determine whether or not it's required
* Provide an extra description

|Operation|Description|Triggered by

|GET|retrieves all the entities of the requested resource|resource is searchable
|GET|retrieves one entity of the requested resource by id|resource is readable
|DELETE|deletes one entity of the requested resource by id|resource is deletable
|POST|creates an entity of the requested resource|resource is creatable
|PUT|updates one entity of the requested resource by id|resource is updatable
|PATCH|updates specific attributes of one entity of the requested resource by id|resource is partially updatable
