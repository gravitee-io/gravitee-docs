== AM Multi Environments introduced

In preparation for the upcoming Cockpit product offering (see link:https://www.gravitee.io/products/roadmap[Roadmap > Cockpit]), we have introduced two concepts:

* link:/am/current/am_adminguide_organizations_and_environments.html#organization[Organization]
* link:/am/current/am_adminguide_organizations_and_environments.html#environment[Environment]

To provide this new feature, new permissions have been created that requires the execution of database migration scripts. (see link:/am/current/am_installguide_migration.html[Migration Guide])

At the UI level, the *global settings* menu is now named *organization settings* and it is accessible at the bottom left corner of the console UI.
