= Portal

Portal can be accessed even if you're not connected (anonymous user). But if you want to play with an API, a user account
is required to subscribe to plans.

Default view in portal shows all the API accessible to the authenticated user (or only _public_ API for anonymous user).

What are the rules for API accessibility:

* Public API
* Private API: if user is a member of the API (user, owner, primary_owner)
