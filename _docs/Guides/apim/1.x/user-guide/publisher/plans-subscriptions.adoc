Once an API is registered, and made public, you can manage subscriptions to it through the platform.
Managing subscriptions and plans is a key feature in Gravitee.io and allows the publisher to provide and regulate access to the API.

== What is a plan ?

A plan provides a service and access layer on your API for the consumer link:/apim/1.x/apim_overview_concepts.html#gravitee-concepts-application[applications].
A plan specifies access limits, subscription validation mode and other configurations to meet the specific applications needs.

image::apim/1.x/api-publisher-guide/plans-subscriptions/plan-diagram.png[Gravitee.io - Plan diagram, 873, 530, align=center, title-align=center]

In API Strategy, we see `API as a Product` concept which helps us to understand the needs of the customers and make the product compelling to them.
Instead of providing only pure technical API resources, API's plans will offer a business/service perspective to the consumers and in the meantime leverage your API product line.

You can imagine the following scenarios :

* Create an Open API plan with a readonly access and an limited request traffic letting potential customers discover and try your API
* Create a Premium plan with public resources and no limit access for your partners
* Create an internal plan with all access to your internal enterprise applications

All these notions can be hard to code in your API and should be manage in external tool such as an Plan.

To subscribe to a Plan, developers must create an link:/apim/1.x/apim_overview_concepts.html#gravitee-concepts-application[application] and choose the Plan they want to subscribe.
That will create a subscription associate with the application. This subscription will be verify in order to accept or deny the incoming request.


== Create a plan

API plans can be manage during API creation process or in the `Portal/Plans` section of the API.

.Create plan

.Manage plan
image::apim/1.x/api-publisher-guide/plans-subscriptions/create-plan-2.png[Gravitee.io - Manage plan, 873, 530, align=center, title-align=center]

When creating plans in Gravitee.io, 4 security types are supported to restrict access to an API. The security types are as follows :

* Keyless (public)
* API Key
* OAuth 2.0
* JWT

== Keyless plan

Keyless plan permits all access for the API and will bypass any security mechanism on the whole request process.

NOTE: Keyless plan can be useful to quickly and easily expose your API to external users and get their feedbacks.
Due to missing consumer identifier token (API key), keyless consumer will be set as `unknown application` in the API analytics part.

== API Key plan

API Key plan lets you enforce verification of API keys during request processing, letting only apps with approved API keys access your APIs.

This plan ensures that API keys are valid, have not been revoked or expired, and are approved to consume the specific resources associated with your API.

NOTE: The API key plan represents the simplest security mechanism and acts more as a unique identifier than a security token since the API key can be easily found in app code.
For stronger security please see OAuth 2.0 and JWT plans.

== OAuth 2.0 plan

OAuth 2.0 plan ensures that access tokens provided by 3rd party OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server are valid. Letting only apps with approved OAuth 2.0 access token access your APIs.

NOTE: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749[OAuth 2.0] is a delegation protocol for authorization decisions across applications and APIs.
It defines standards endpoints and flows to both obtain and verify access tokens. If you want to learn more about OAuth 2.0 you can take a look at https://oauth.net/2/[oauth.net].

To create an OAuth 2.0 plan, you will first need an OAuth 2.0 resource that represents your OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server.

Go to `Design/Resources` section of your API and create a new `Generic OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Resource`

NOTE: If you use https://gravitee.io/[Gravitee.io Access Management], we provide a dedicated OAuth 2.0 AM resource.

.Create OAuth 2.0 resource
image::apim/1.x/api-publisher-guide/plans-subscriptions/create-oauth2-resource.png[Gravitee.io - Create OAuth 2.0 resource, 873, 530, align=center, title-align=center]

* Set the OAuth 2.0 Authorization server URL
* Set the https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7662[Token introspection endpoint] URI with the correct HTTP method and https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-3.3[scope] delimiter.
* If you want to obtain the requested claims about the end-user you can enter the http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#UserInfo[UserInfo Endpoint] URI
* Enter the `client id` and `client secret` used for token introspection.

NOTE: Why do I need to set up a client id and client secret ? As per https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7662#section-2.1[RFC 7662], to prevent token scanning attacks,
the introspection endpoint MUST also require some form of authorization to access this endpoint such as client authentication.
Don't forget to create an OAuth 2.0 client acting as a resource server from your OAuth 2.0 authorization server.

Once the OAuth2 resource is set up you can create an OAuth 2.0 plan. Go to `Portal/Plans` section of your API and create a new plan.

On the secure section (second step) choose `OAuth2` Authorization type,  write down the OAuth2 resource's name previously created and choose if you want to check specific https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-3.3[scopes] to access the API.

.Create OAuth 2.0 plan
image::apim/1.x/api-publisher-guide/plans-subscriptions/create-oauth2-plan.png[Gravitee.io - Create OAuth 2.0 plan, 873, 530, align=center, title-align=center]

* Click `NEXT` and create your plan by clicking on the `SAVE` button.

NOTE: After plan creation, the plan is in staging mode, don't forget to publish it to make it available to the consumers.

Your API is now OAuth 2.0 secured and the consumers must call the API with the `Authorization Bearer :token:` HTTP header in order to access the API's resources.

NOTE: Applications who want to subscribe to an OAuth 2.0 plan, must have a existing client with a valid `client_id` registered in the OAuth 2.0 authorization server.
The `client_id` will be use to make the connection between the OAuth 2.0 client and the Gravitee.io consumer application.

== JWT plan

Json Web Tokens (JWT) plan ensures that JWT token issued by third party are valid. Letting only apps with approved JWT token access your APIs.

https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519[JSON Web Tokens] are an open method for representing claims securely between two parties.
JWT are digitally-signed using HMAC shared keys or RSA public/private key pairs. JWT plan allows you to verify the signature of the JWT and check if the JWT is still valid according to its expiry date.

NOTE: JWT defines some https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1[registered claim names] including subject, issuer, audience, expiration time, and not-before time. In addition to these claims, the inbound JWT payload
MUST contains the `client_id` claim* to make the connection between the JWT and the Gravitee.io application's subscription.

*The policy is looking for a client ID on the payload as follow:

* First on the azp claim
* Then on the aud claim
* Finally on the client_id claim

To create an JWT plan, go to `Portal/Plans` section of your API and create a new plan.

On the secure section (second step) choose `JWT` Authorization type and set up the public key used to verify the incoming JWT token.

NOTE: Public key can also be set in the `gravitee.yml` file. See link:/apim/1.x/apim_policies_jwt.html[JWT policy] for more information. Currently Gravitee.io only support RSA Public Key format.

.Create JWT plan
image::apim/1.x/api-publisher-guide/plans-subscriptions/create-jwt-plan.png[Gravitee.io - Create JWT plan, 873, 530, align=center, title-align=center]

* Click `NEXT` and create your plan by clicking on the `SAVE` button.

NOTE: After plan creation, the plan is in staging mode, don't forget to publish it to make it available to the consumers.

Your API is now JWT secured and the consumers must call the API with the `Authorization Bearer :JWT Token:` HTTP header in order to access the API’s resources.

== Advanced settings, what can I use plans for ?

Plans provide and secure access to the API thanks to their Authorization type, let's see what you can do more with Plans.

=== Limit request traffic

Plan provide tools to maintain and optimize traffic management and protect API backends health.

==== Rate-limiting

Rate limit how many HTTP requests an application can make in a given period of seconds or minutes.

.Enforces limit of 1 000 requests per minute
image::apim/1.x/api-publisher-guide/plans-subscriptions/create-plan-rate-limit.png[Gravitee.io - Create plan - Rate-Limit , 873, 530, align=center, title-align=center]


NOTE: Rate-limit will help you limit the sudden increase in the number of requests at any point in time.

==== Quota

Quota specifies the number of requests allow to call API backends in the given time interval.

.Enforces limit of 100 000 requests per day
image::apim/1.x/api-publisher-guide/plans-subscriptions/create-plan-quota.png[Gravitee.io - Create plan - Rate-Limit , 873, 530, align=center, title-align=center]

NOTE: Quota can be use to business/financial requirements where you decide the limit of how many calls partner/third-party apps can do in a period of time.

=== Path Authorization

Path authorization allows you to constraint access to a subset of the API resources.

.Allow only GET requests
image::apim/1.x/api-publisher-guide/plans-subscriptions/create-plan-path-authorization.png[Gravitee.io - Create plan - Path Authorization , 873, 530, align=center, title-align=center]

NOTE: With Path Authorization it's possible to make an readonly API for public members and give access to more resource for premium members.

== Manage subscriptions

Plans will let consumers to request for subscription and begin to play with your API.

.API Plans from consumers' perspective
image::apim/1.x/api-publisher-guide/plans-subscriptions/plans-subscriptions.png[Gravitee.io - API plans , 873, 530, align=center, title-align=center]

=== Approving subscriptions

If you set your plan to auto validate subscription mode, you have nothing to do, consumers will be ready to access the API.
Otherwise, if you set manual approval, the publisher must approve subscriptions by following these steps :

NOTE: If you enable mail or portal notification, you will see that a task requires your attention to validate the subscription.

1. Go to `Portal/Subscriptions` of your API
2. Select the `Pending` subscription
3. Click `ACCEPT`, enter the start date and end date (no end date means forever) to approve the subscription

.Approve subscription
image::apim/1.x/api-publisher-guide/plans-subscriptions/approve-subscription.png[Gravitee.io - approve subscription , 873, 530, align=center, title-align=center]

=== Revoking subscriptions

Every subscriptions can be revoked to invalidate access to the APIs. Go to `Portal/Subscriptions` of your API, select the subscription you want to cancel and click `CLOSE`

.Revoke subscription
image::apim/1.x/api-publisher-guide/plans-subscriptions/revoke-subscription.png[Gravitee.io - revoke subscription , 873, 530, align=center, title-align=center]
