The CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a mechanism that allows resources on a *web page* to be requested from another domain.

To understand well how to deal with CORS, you should first take a look at the https://www.w3.org/TR/cors[specification].

== Configuration

=== Access-Control-Allow-Origin

Allow to specify one or multiples origin(s) that may access the resource.
If you want to allow all origins, you can put `*` but it's not safe for production.

=== Access-Control-Allow-Methods

Specifies the method or methods allowed when accessing the resource. This is used in response to a preflight request.

=== Access-Control-Allow-Headers

Here you specify the headers allowed to be used by your requests.
Typically, on your request headers you will have a header `Access-Control-Request-Headers` which request CORS to be configured to allow its values.

Let's see a simple use case:

A user make a call with a header `Access-Control-Request-Headers: my-header`.

- if the CORS `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` is not configured with the header `my-header`, the request will get a 400 HTTP status.
- if the CORS `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` is configured with the header `my-header` at least, the request will get a 200 HTTP status.

**The wildcard (`*`) is not allowed here.**

=== Access-Control-Allow-Credentials

Indicates whether or not the response to the request can be exposed when the credentials flag is true.

=== Access-Control-Allow-Max-Age

This header indicates how long the results of a preflight request can be cached (-1 if disabled).

=== Access-Control-Expose-Headers

This header lets a server whitelist headers that browsers are allowed to access.
