APIM natively support several types of authentication for accessing APIM:

* Authentication providers (such as in-memory, LDAP and databases)
* Social providers (such as GitHub and Google)
* A custom OAuth2 / OpenID authorization server

== Identity providers

You can specify as many identity providers as you want. APIM API loops through the providers in the order they are declared in the `providers` section of the `gravitee.yml` file until one of the authentication methods completes successfully.

== Configuring authentication in APIM

NOTE: In this section, the _organization_ scope roughly corresponds to APIM Console, and the _environment_ scope roughly corresponds to APIM Portal. For a better understanding of the scope of application of identity providers, we recommend you read the link:/apim/3.x/apim_adminguide_organizations_and_environments.html[Organizations and environments] section of the Administration Guide.

You can configure Social providers and define custom OAuth2 / OpenID authorization servers in APIM Console.
All identity providers are defined at organization level. You can then choose whether to make each provider available at environment level as well.

You can see which identity providers are defined in APIM Console as follows:

* To view organization-level identity providers, click *Organization settings > Authentication* (note that this list also indicates which providers are enabled for environment-level authentication)
* To view identity providers which are also enabled for environment-level authentication, click *Settings > Authentication*

=== Creating providers with the required scope

You define new providers in APIM Console with the *Organization settings > Authentication* menu entry.
If you want the identity provider to be available at environment level as well, you can enable it for APIM Portal authentication when you specify its details.

=== Activating providers

Once a new provider is defined, you need to activate it in the organization and/or environment-level list by checking the *Activated* checkbox, to make it available to the relevant login window:

=== Example
In this example, three providers have been defined -- Google, GitHub and GraviteeIO AM.

* Only GitHub and GraviteeIO AM are *activated* for APIM Console authentication (in the organization-level list).
* Only Google and GraviteeIO AM are *enabled* for APIM Portal authentication.

image::apim/3.x/installation/authentication/provider-organization-list.png[]

You can see that *GitHub* and *GraviteeIO AM* are visible on the APIM Console login screen:

image::apim/3.x/installation/authentication/console-login-screen.png[]

In the environment-level list, only Google and GraviteeIO AM appear, and only GraviteeIO AM is *activated*.

image::apim/3.x/installation/authentication/provider-environment-list.png[]

As a result, you can only see *GraviteeIO AM* on the APIM Portal login screen:
