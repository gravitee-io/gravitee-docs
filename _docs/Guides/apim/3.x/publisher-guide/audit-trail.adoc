You can use the APIM audit trail for monitoring the behaviour of your API and platform over time.
For example, you can use it in conjunction with the analytics feature to identify a point at which your API behavior changed, view the configuration which caused the change and roll back to an earlier configuration if required.

APIM Console provides audit trails at two levels of granularity:

* A platform-wide audit trail, which you can view with the *Audit* menu option:

* An API-specific audit trail, which you can view with the API *Audit* menu option in APIM Console:

The sections below focus on the API audit trail.

== API audit trail

You can use the API audit trail to:

* view a list of API events, filtered by event type and date, with a toggle to show and hide the JSON associated with the event
* view a history of API deployments, including details of the configuration each deployment, a diff feature for comparing deployments and a rollback feature for rolling back the API to an earlier stage
* view a visual map of API events

== API history

You can use the history feature of the audit trail to view the different stages of the API lifecycle and their associated configuration.

Each stage corresponds to a new deployment of the API, with a number and a label (if specified at deployment time) identifying the deployment:

=== View the details of an API deployment

. In the API *Audit* page, click *History*.
. Select the API deployment to see more details.
. Select a flow and click through the tabs to see its configuration details. In the *DESIGN* tab, you can select a policy to view details of the policy configuration.

. To view the deployment configuration in JSON format, toggle *Mode* to *Definition*.

. To copy the deployment configuration in JSON format, click *COPY TO CLIPBOARD*. You can do this in either definition or design mode.
. To view a diff of the deployment configuration, click *DIFF* and select another deployment stage to view the difference between the two deployments. If this is not the latest deployment, you can also click *DIFF WITH PUBLISHED API* to view the difference with the latest deployment. The numbers in green and red at the top indicate the number of additions to and subtractions from the definition.

=== Roll back your API to an earlier deployment

You can roll back to an earlier deployment of your API. This does not remove the later deployments, it adds a new deployment in the history with a configuration which corresponds to the deployment selected for rollback.

. Open the API history as described above.
. Click the API deployment to roll back to.
. Click *ROLLBACK* and confirm in the prompt.
. To complete the rollback, select the new rollback deployment and click *DEPLOY*.

TIP: To view a diff of the deployment before deploying, you can use the diff feature as described above.

. (Optional) Add a deployment label to identify to the new deployment.
