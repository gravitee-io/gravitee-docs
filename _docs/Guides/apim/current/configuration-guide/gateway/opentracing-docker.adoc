== Overview
To test out Gravitee's distributed tracing feature, use the instructions below.

=== 1. Start The Jaeger Component
Start the Jaeger component with the Docker image by running this command:

----
docker run -d --name jaeger \
  -p 5775:5775/udp \
  -p 6831:6831/udp \
  -p 6832:6832/udp \
  -p 5778:5778 \
  -p 16686:16686 \
  -p 14268:14268 \
  -p 14250:14250 \
  -p 9411:9411 \
  jaegertracing/all-in-one:1.24
----

NOTE: This is the Docker run command for installing Jaeger is direct from https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/1.25/getting-started/#all-in-one[Jaegertracing.io] and no customizations to the configuration are included.

Visit the https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/1.25/getting-started/#all-in-one[Jaeger website] for more information on the Jaeger tracer from Uber.

*PRO-TIP:* Running this Docker command will also provide access to the JaegerUI, which can be reached using its default port: *http://localhost:16686*.

You can confirm Jaeger has been enabled and is running by checking Docker.

=== 2. Install The .ZIP File For The Jaeger Tracer Plugin
Since the Jaeger tracer is not bundled by default,
https://download.gravitee.io/#graviteeio-apim/plugins/tracers/gravitee-tracer-jaeger/[click here] and add the plugin for the Gravitee Jaeger Tracer .ZIP file to the configuration of your APIM Gateway instance.

=== 3. Test OpenTracing

1. Now that you have OpenTracing enabled, run your API Gateway and APIM.

2. Open APIM and choose an API that already has a policy assigned to it (or create a test API and add any policies you like for this test). Now, call your API.

3. To see your calls, open the helpful, user-friendly JaegerUI by visiting http://localhost:16686  (note that JaegerUI was automatically installed earlier in the process). Click *Search* and find the API you called.

In these examples, you’ll also notice that each policy traversed is listed on a different line to provide greater visibility and assist with debugging. You can even see timestamp info on the detailed view.

== Configure Environment Variables
You can configure the environment variables as needed in the Jaeger Gateway. For example,

----
gravitee_service_tracing_enabled: true
gravitee_services_tracing_jaegar_host: localhost
gravitee_services_tracing_jaeger_port: 14250
----

== How To Enable OpenTracing Via Docker Compose

You can also enable OpenTracing using Jaeger as a tracer with this Docker Compose. link:/https://github.com/gravitee-io/gravitee-api-management/tree/master/docker/quick-setup/opentracing-jaeger[Click here] to access the `docker-compose.yml`.

With this option enabled, you can continue to call your APIs through your gateway with the usual host: `http://localhost:8082/myapi`.

=== 1. How To Run OpenTracing With Jaeger

1. Since the Jaeger tracer is not bundled by default, **you must download the .ZIP file** for the version you want to run (https://download.gravitee.io/#graviteeio-apim/plugins/tracers/gravitee-tracer-jaeger/[click here] to download the .ZIP).

2. After downloading, **you must copy this into the `opentracing-jaeger/.plugins` directory** using the command below:
+
`APIM_VERSION={APIM_VERSION} docker-compose up -d`

3. Be sure to fetch last version of images by running this command:
+
----
export APIM_VERSION={APIM_VERSION} && docker-compose down -v && docker-compose pull && docker-compose up
----

== How Can I See My Traces?

Jaeger comes with a helpful, user-friendly UI that allows you to see your calls. To access this UI, visit http://localhost:16686.

Then, select **gio_apim_gateway** in the _Service_ list and click the _Find Traces_ button.
