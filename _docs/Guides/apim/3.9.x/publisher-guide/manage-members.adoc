= API users and ownership

WWhen you first create an API, it is created as a private API by default, so users can't access it in APIM Portal or subscribe to it.

You can grant specific users or groups access to a private API by managing its members.

NOTE: Only users with the required permissions can manage an application's members. For more details, see link:../administration-guide/roles-permissions.html[Roles and permissions].

== Roles

By default, APIM includes three membership roles:

[cols="2*", options="header"]
|===
^|Role
^|Description

.^| *Primary Owner*
.^| When an API is created, the Primary Owner is the creator of the API. A Primary Owner can perform all possible actions on an API.

.^| *Owner*
.^| Owner is similar to the Primary Owner role. An Owner can perform all the same actions on an API apart from change the context-path of the API or delete it.

.^| *User*
.^| A User is a person who can access the API and subscribe to it through a plan.

== Transfer ownership

You can transfer ownership of an API or application from one user to another. You do this when the current Primary Owner leaves a project, for example.

. If you want to transfer ownership for an:

[NOTE]

You can only select a Primary Owner Group which you belong to.
If your Primary owner mode is configured as *GROUP*, you can only select a Primary Owner Group and not a user.
