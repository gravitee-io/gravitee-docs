Existing on-premise installations of APIM and AM can be registered in Cockpit. This will allow users to create and propagate new organizations and environments to these existing installations.

A registered installation communicates with Cockpit via a WebSocket connection, secured with TLS.

== How to register a new installation

To register new APIM or AM installations with Cockpit, you need to:

* Have a Cockpit connector in your installation plugins
* Download the certificate to allow secure connection via Cockpit UI
* Install the certificate, and restart your installation.

Detailed information is available in the *How to register a new installation* link, below *Installations* in the dashboard.

After registration, the installation is displayed as a pending installation in Cockpit:

. Accept the installation by clicking it, selecting the environment to which to link the installation and clicking *ACCEPT*.
