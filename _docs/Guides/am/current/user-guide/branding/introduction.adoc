= Branding

AM can be customized to suit your organization's brand requirements and user expectations.
AM branding gives you a consistent user experience when navigating between customer applications and AM server.

You can create customized templates for individual applications or across all applications in a security domain.

NOTE: AM uses link:https://www.thymeleaf.org/[Thymeleaf^] syntax to dynamically customize your templates with execution context values such as the current application, the current end user and the current HTTP request.
