The link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-security-topics[OAuth 2.0 Security Best Current Practice^] describes security requirements and other recommendations for clients and servers implementing OAuth 2.0.

We recommend you note the following points:

- *Use HTTPs*: communicate with AM server over HTTPs all the way.
- *Token expiration*: use short-lived access tokens (a couple of minutes) to limit the risk of leaked access tokens.
- *Force PKCE*: PKCE must be used for SPA and mobile/native applications.
- *Restrict data payload*: tokens can be easily decoded and propagated to multiple layers, so add the minimum information to the payload.
- *Set up callbacks*: configure application callbacks to avoid open redirection attacks.
- *Privilege restriction*: limit the use of OAuth 2.0 scopes to strictly match application actions.
