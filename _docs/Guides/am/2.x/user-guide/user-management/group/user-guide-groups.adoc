NOTE: Currently only users created by the AM management API or the SCIM protocol and external users who have been already logged can be found.

=== User/Group roles

Note: By default, users are stored in the pre-defined `Default Identity Provider` which is available out of the box for each security domain.
You can apply role mapping with your group members.
