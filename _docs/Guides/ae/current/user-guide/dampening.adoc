== Overview

When a condition is validated many times in a very short period, there is a risk of flooding users with notifications. To mitigate this, AE includes the concept of _dampening_.

When defining a condition for a given rule, it is mandatory to associate a dampening algorithm.

== Modes (algorithms)

=== Strict count

This mode is used to represent "X consecutive true evaluations".

=== Relaxed count

This mode is used to represent "X true evaluations of Y total evaluations".

=== Relaxed time

This mode is used to represent "X true evaluations in T time".

=== Strict time

This mode is used to represent "Only true evaluations in T time".
