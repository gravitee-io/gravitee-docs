This section is explaining how to integrate the Alert Engine within Gravitee.io API Management.

If you are running a fresh installation of Gravitee.io Enterprise API Platform or if you are running Enterprise
Docker images, you can skip the installation part.

IMPORTANT: For being able to integrate API Management with Alert Engine, your API Management platform must
be an link:/ee/ee_introduction.html[Enterprise version].

== Installation

=== Download connector

[source,bash]
[subs="attributes"]
$ curl -L https://download.gravitee.io/graviteeio-ae/plugins/connectors/gravitee-ae-connectors-ws/gravitee-ae-connectors-ws-{{site.products.ae.version}}.zip -o gravitee-ae-connectors-ws-{{site.products.ae.version}}.zip

=== Install connector

In this section, we admit that ${GRAVITEEIO_HOME} can refer to both the API Gateway and the Management API.

[source,bash]
[subs="attributes"]
$ cp gravitee-ae-connectors-ws-{{site.products.ae.version}}.zip ${GRAVITEEIO_HOME}/plugins/

== Configuration

For both the API Gateway and the Management API, you have to configure access to Alert Engine through WebSockets. This can
be done that way:

```yaml
alerts:
  alert-engine:
    enabled: true
    ws:
      discovery: true
      endpoints:
        - http://localhost:8072/
      security:
        username: admin
        password: adminadmin
```

=== Endpoints
You can have as many endpoints as you need. The node will select one of them in round-robin fashion.

=== Discovery mode
Discovery mode is very useful when running a cluster of Alert Engine. By using it, you just have to refer to a single
AE node and the other nodes from the cluster will be automatically registered.
