== Log in to APIM Portal

You can access APIM Portal as a public user without logging in. You only need to log in to APIM Portal if you want to work with private APIs. For more information, see the link:/Guides/APIM/current/consumer-guide/introduction.html[API Consumer Guide^].

You access APIM Portal using the `http://PORTAL_UI_SERVER_DOMAIN` URL created during installation.

During the APIM installation process a default administrator account is created. By default, the login details for the APIM Portal administrator account are `admin / admin`.
Ordinary users of APIM Portal need to obtain their user credentials from an administrator.

To log in:

. Open APIM Portal and click *Sign in*.

By default, the login details for the APIM Console administrator account are `admin / admin`.

To log in:

==== API status

You can view the status of all your APIs or only APIs with health checking enabled, by toggling on and off the *View all APIs* option.

For APIs with health checking enabled, clicking the detail of the API redirects you to the Health check page. For more details, see link:/Guides/APIM/current/publisher-guide/backend-services.html[Load balancing, failover, and health check^].

The APIs can be in three different states:

* If the uptime is over 95%, the API is shown as in an OK state (green)
* If the uptime is between 80 and 95%, the API is shown as in a warning state (orange)
* If the uptime is under 80%, the API is shown as in an error state (red)

You can disable this panel in the Console settings.

==== Customize the dashboard

You can customize the default dashboard view by resizing or removing widgets, or by adding custom metrics, as described in link:./add-custom-metrics-dashboards.html[How to add custom metrics to dashboards^].

To perform more advanced configuration, see link:/Guides/APIM/current/configuration-guide/console/general-config.html#home-dashboard[Home dashboard^] in the Configuration Guide.
