This guide walks you through the process of creating your first API by using the Web UI Portal.
Gravitee.io Management UI can be accessed using the following URL:

http://MANAGEMENT_UI_SERVER_DOMAIN (see link:/apim/1.x/apim_installguide_portal.html[Gravitee.io Management UI installation] for more information)

NOTE: *Gravitee.io Echo API* : In this tutorial we will use the https://api.gravitee.io/echo[Gravitee.io Echo API] to set up our first proxy API. The Gravitee.io Echo API returns JSON-formatted data via the following URL : https://api.gravitee.io/echo

. Login to http://MANAGEMENT_UI_SERVER_DOMAIN. (Default Administrator account is admin/admin, see link:/apim/1.x/apim_installguide_authentication.html[security section] for more information)
